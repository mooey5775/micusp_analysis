Dear Dad,
I'm so sorry to hear that Mr. and Mrs. Friedson's son, Brian, has been diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Muscular Dystrophy is an inherited disease that causes a person's muscle fibers to be highly susceptible to damage, and over time, these muscles become weaker. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, in particular, is the most severe of the nine types of muscular dystrophies, and it affects voluntary muscles (muscles used to purposefully move body parts), the heart, and breathing muscles.
As is the case with most DMD sufferers, Brian is male and was diagnosed early in his life (most are diagnosed between the ages of 2 and 6). He exhibited general weakness in his hips, pelvis, thighs, and shoulders, and his calves were enlarged. He fell frequently and had difficulty getting up, running, and jumping. Mr. And Mrs. Friedson said that he had a waddling-like gait and wondered if he suffered from mild mental retardation. He was officially diagnosed with DMD following genetic testing and a muscle biopsy (where some of his muscle cells were removed and observed with a microscope). Prior to that, the doctors may have developed a suspicion of muscular dystrophy using blood tests, ultrasound, and electromyography.
The majority of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy patients are male because DMD is a recessive trait carried on the X chromosome. Chromosomes are the small units of genetic material that carry traits, and half of a person's chromosomes come from each of their parents. Thus, each person has two copies of genetic material for each trait. Recessive traits, like DMD, are only observed if both copies of the gene carry the recessive trait. However, the genes that determine gender, the X and Y-chromosomes, carry different genes. Males have one X and one Y-chromosome, but females have two X-chromosomes. Thus, if a male gets the recessive trait on the X-chromosome from his mother, he will express it. Females, on the other hand, will only express it if both copies of the trait (one X-chromosome from her mother and one X-chromosome from her father) are recessive.
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is caused by the absence of functional dystrophin, which is the result of this recessive trait. Dystrophin is a protein (a functional molecule in the body) that is needed by muscle cells for structural support. More specifically, dystrophin helps to anchor the internal cellular cytoskeleton (which is like a skeleton for the cell) to the surface membrane of the cell. Without dystrophin, the cell membrane, which is usually only permeable to water and specific other substances, allows other things to pass through as well. When this foreign matter enters the cell, the cell increases in internal pressure and explodes, which destroys the muscle cell-by-cell, essentially piece-by-piece.
DMD will probably kill Brian in his late teens or early 20s from problems with his heart or lungs. Although there is no cure, current medications (including prednisone) and therapies can slow the progression of the disease. In addition, current research on mice is promising and may lead to the development of more effective therapies in the future.
Best wishes,

Although spatial patterning is well studied, but we know little about the mechanism underlying the sequential generation of different cell types. Utilizing various molecular markers and immunostaining in Drosophila, this paper showed that neural precursors sequentially express the transcription factors Hunchback(Hb)->Kruppel(Kr)->Pdm->Castor(Cas). Besides, the authors of this paper demonstrated that Hb and Kr were necessary and sufficient for first-born and second-born cell fates respectively. Furthermore, their functions were observed in several lineages and were independent of cell type involved.
First of all, the authors identified Kr as a new deep layer transcription factor and showed the expression pattern of the four transcription factors. They found that Hb, Kr, Pdm and Cas were sequentially and transiently expressed in neuroblasts. Then they demonstrated that these transient expressed transcription factors maintained for a period of time in their neural progeny. They characterized three model neuronblast to prove that, including an early forming neuroblast(7-1) and two late-forming neuroblasts(7-3 and 2-4). Moreover, they found that the gene expression of these transcription factors was not correlated to a particular cell type.
Besides, they did experiments to see whether Hb and Kr were necessary and sufficient for specifying first-born and second-born cell fates, respectively. They showed that in hb-neuroblast 7-3 lineage, the number of GMC-2 doubled at the expense of 1/1G neurons or first-born 1/1G neurons were specifically lost. In contrast, in neuroblast 7-3 that continuously expressed Hb, all neurons exhibit first-born 1/1G fates. These findings implied that Hb was indeed not only necessary but also sufficient for specifying first-born cell fates. In addition, they examined the effect of Hb on first-born motoneuron fate in multiple neuroblast lineages, including lineage 1-1 and 4-2. They found that the phenotypes of hb-were consistent with a transformation of GMC-1 to a later-born GMC fate while continuously expressing Hb produced duplications or triplications of first-born cell fate. They also observed a reduction in the number of motoneuron projections in hb-and an increase in the number of motoneurons in neuroblast that continuously expressing Hb. Furthermore, they also examined the effect of Hb on first-born glial cell fates. The hb-mutants lacked first-born MM-CB glia at the midline, but have no change in the number of later-born channel glia at the midline. In contrast, misexpression of Hb in all neuroblasts resulted in extra MM-CB glia at the midline and a decrease in the number of midline channel glia. The results above suggested that Hb's regulation on first-born cell fate was independent of cell type identity.
In addition, the authors showed that Kr was necessary and sufficient for second-born cell fates. In neuroblast 7-3 lineage, Kr-had variably effects on first-born 1/1G sibling neurons and second-born interneuron 2 was almost always missing while the third-born interneuron 3 was almost always normal. In contrast, continuously expressing Kr resulted in all but two GMC-1 neurons differentiate as GMC-2 derived interneuron 2. In 7-1 lineage, Kr mutants frequently missed one of the U3/U4 motoneurons while continuously expressing Kr leaded to extra Eve+ neurons with all differentiating as U3 or U4 motoneurons except the normal pair of early-born U1/U2 motoneurons.
Last, the authors examined the regulatory interaction between Hb, Kr, Pdm and Cas expression by overexpressing each transcription factor and observing whether gene expression of the other had an increase or decrease. They showed that each gene can activate the next gene in the pathway and repress the "next plus one" gene.
Generally speaking, I think the paper is fairly convincing in demonstrating the effect of Hb and Kr. However, it has some weak points. First, the paper does not provide enough evidences to support the whole sequential Hb->Kr-> Pdm->Cas expression in neuroblasts. Besides, some figures seemed not so clear. For instances, in fig1b, the cell pattern seems a mosaic and can hardly tell the layer. So it might be difficult to tell which cell groups change the gene expression during different time period. In fig5I, I can not see the "striking increase" in the number of motoneurons. Last, the finding that regulation of Hb and Kr is independent of cell type identity might not be so surprising because at the start of differentiation, those cells might still not have cell type identity.
The paper leaves many interesting questions. For instance, as the paper mentioned, the four transcription factors examined were not necessary for driving sequential gene expression. Then what is the driving mechanism underlying this sequential expression? Besides, the temporal gene expression pattern in neuroblasts is very similar to the spatial gene expression pattern at cellular blastoderm. Is there any relation between these two pattern?

Gorodnichenko, Martinez-Vazquez, and Peter use household level data from the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey to estimate the effects of Russia's 2001 tax reform on a measure of tax evasion. The paper also provides estimates of the productivity response to the flat tax reform and of the deadweight loss from personal income tax that incorporate estimates of tax evasion and consumption changes. Difference-in-difference and regression-discontinuity inspired approaches allow the authors to distinguish between changes in voluntary compliance and in tax enforcement policies as reasons for the decrease in tax evasion. Changes in voluntary compliance are found to be a more significant part of the overall decline in tax evasion. The estimates of deadweight loss imply that there is a smaller gain in efficiency from the tax reform than implied by approaches that do not account for changes in tax evasion and consumption.
The measure used as a proxy for tax evasion in the paper is the gap between consumption and income. Intuitively, this makes sense in the context of the permanent income hypothesis since the implied assumption is that people still consume out of (permanent) income they don't report. The authors do well to point out that the PIH assumption that people can freely borrow and lend to smooth consumption that may not be valid, especially in Russia. Using the consumption-income gap can still function as a measure of tax evasion assuming households consume out of cash they have on hand. The minor point about borrowing constraints being softened by intra-family transfers isn't well supported with evidence in the paper but doesn't really matter since the PIH is not strictly necessary in this context. However, estimates of the extent of intra-family transfers could be an interesting part of the story especially if these transfers can be used to evade taxes. Such transfers are counted as consumption in the framework of this paper.
Government sector employees are found to have a larger consumption-income gap than other workers. The consumption-income gap for private sector employees is estimated to decrease more after the tax reform than the gap for public sector employees because they are supposedly more likely to change their reported income. Public sector employees are given to have less motivation to change reported income because income obtained in excess of their official salary is likely to have been obtained illegally. A similar analysis is done for skilled and unskilled workers based on the incentives of firms to pay skilled workers with non-taxable means. Given estimates of the size of the shadow economy in Russia, it seems that these assumptions about the relative tendency of people to report income based on occupation could be examined further. The propensity of people to report legal versus illegal income certainly plays a role here, as does the amount of illicit income people receive. One possible way to answer these questions empirically might be through surveys. Some surveys like those used to construct corruption indices might be helpful. Surveys that target firms like the World Bank's Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (hereafter, BEEPS) could also be useful in regard. The BEEPS contains information about illicit payments made to public officials as well as information about payments received and labor practices. Using additional survey data to get a feel for the relative magnitude of illicit payments and types of income in the private sector and would seem to be a useful extension of the analysis.
I also took an initial look at other countries that have had flat tax reforms as well as readily available household level surveys of income and expenditures. Latvia might be a possible country to use to extend this paper's techniques. Major tax reform legislation was first introduced in 1995. There are consumer surveys (HBS) for 1995-2003.
There have also been additional rate adjustments. Most of the other countries that have pursued flat tax reform do not seem to have household level expenditure data available for the years surrounding reform. In some cases; Kyrgyzstan, Ukraine, and Mongolia for example, tax reform only occurred in the last couple of years so it might be possible to extend the analysis to these countries at some point. In other cases, flat tax reform was instituted in the 1990s but there doesn't seem to be survey data available. It might be the case that the data are just harder to find, so this is something that I plan to look into further.

At the beginning of the lesson, does the teacher elicit both students' ideas about the new content and predictions about the phenomena?
I think that this lesson does a good job at eliciting student ideas and predictions in the beginning of the lesson. First, the lesson introduces the concept of friction and allows students to explain what they think about when they see that word. Then, the lesson gives students a chance to make a prediction about the distance they assume the car will roll in the experiment that they will perform. However, perhaps to elicit more student ideas I may include a question like: Where do we see friction in our lives? Or, how does friction affect our lives? (Perhaps questions like these could make the importance of this lesson more explicit to students?
At the beginning of the lesson, do students have the opportunity to give explanations for their ideas about the new content and
Students do have the chance to give an explanation for their initial predictions about the distance the car will roll. In fact, this is something they need to include on their student notebook pages. However, I do not see clear evidence for explanations for student ideas. Therefore it may be important to include a follow up question in the initial discussion on friction like: How do you know that? Or, why do you think that? I also think that posing questions hat could relate more to students' lives, like the questions listed in my response to the first question, could also have the potential to prompt more student explanation.
At the beginning of the lesson, do students have the opportunity to record their ideas and predictions and share them with others in the class?
Students have the opportunity to record their predictions in their notebooks. It is not clear whether students share these predictions with their classmates; therefore I would include a specific statement in the lesson that says: Have some students share their predictions in the discussions. Students also have the opportunity to share their ideas about friction with classmates, but they do not have the opportunity to record their initial ideas. To address this weakness I would first have students write a few sentences about their ideas when they hear the word friction. Then I would have students share the sentences they recorded with classmates (either in a whole-class setting) or in partner talk with the individuals that they are sitting next to.
Does the lesson provide teachers with assessments that allow them to assess their students' inquiry skills and understanding of science ideas?
I really like how this lesson aligns their assessments directly with the objectives that they have laid out. So, it appears that it does provide teacher with assessments that they can use to test skills. It suggests that teachers can assess students understanding of inquiry by observing students during lab, looking at student notebooks, and observing discussions.
Does the lesson provide teachers with assessments that allow each student to demonstrate his or her understanding and skills?
The teacher can assess each student's understanding by looking at their individual notebook worksheets. Therefore the lesson does provide some opportunities for the teacher to observe the abilities of each individual. However, I don't think that the teacher can get a sense of every student's ability by simply observing students in the experiment activity and the lab activity. I think that it would be helpful for the teacher to record some notes during this time if at all possible. I also think that it would be easier for the teacher to assess each student's understandings and thinking if she had them record their initial thinking about friction. Lastly, I recognize that it is difficult to assess some of the inquiry based objectives especially if these objectives will be accomplished by engaging in an activity. Therefore, I think that this lesson overall does a nice job providing assessments that can allow the teacher to see each students skills.
Does the lesson provide teachers with assessments that require students to apply their ideas to a new task or situation?
In this lesson there is an activity that could be used to extend students to a new situation with friction. In this section they investigate shoe traction and friction. However, this section is quite brief and it does not explicitly provide an assessment that the teacher can use. However, if this activity was expanded I think that it could have the potential to provide an assessment. For example, I may have students write their predictions about shoe soles and which could provide the most amount of friction along with an explanation. Then after testing soles and their friction I would have students engage in a discussion, much like the one that occurred earlier in this lesson.
Does the lesson help you as a teacher attend to the needs of individual students in your classroom?
I think that this lesson does provide the teacher to attend to the needs of individual students. Even though the lesson may not clearly state how the teacher does this, I think that this lesson would provide for these opportunities. First, the teacher can attend to students needs as they arise in the group experiment. At this time the teacher can walk around and assist individuals as needed. Secondly, I think that the initial discussion could provide the teacher with a sense of what students know about friction. This knowledge could be used by the teacher when leading the wrap-up discussion. At this point, the teacher could ask questions that could lead to the discussion and revision of previous alternate ideas that students may have had about friction. Therefore, even though this lesson doesn't clearly say how teachers can attend to the needs of individual students, I think it provides several opportunities in which the teacher would engage in this process.
Does the lesson provide students with opportunities to make connections between the scientific ideas and their personal, cultural, and social experiences?
I think that this lesson could provide students with more opportunities to make connections between scientific ideas and their personal, cultural, and social experiences. I think that the shoe example may fit into students lives better than the car example, because students have experience with shoes on a daily basis, however, some students may not have experience with toy cars, sandpaper, or corrugated cardboard. However, I was impressed that the students got to observe each item before using it in the experiment. By allowing for this exploration, each student will have had at least one shared experience with these materials. However, to really help students provide connections I think it would be important to include a question either in the final discussion or the initial discussion that asks students to think about how they see friction in their lives. I think that this could help students see that friction can be beneficial and harmful (which was an objective of this lesson) and I also think that it could provide more opportunities for students to make connections and understand the importance of friction.
Does the lesson help teachers make scientific terminology accessible to all students?
As I said earlier, I was impressed that this lesson provided a shared experience with sand paper and corrugated cardboard to the class. I think that this would help students understand what these items are without having previously experienced them. While the terms sandpaper and corrugated cardboard wouldn't be considered scientific terminology, it does serve of an example where the lesson is making the science accessible to all students. I think that there are other examples in this lesson where the teacher is helping to make scientific terminology accessible to all students. For example, the teacher initially explains what friction is to the students (after hearing some ideas) then the student engage in an experiment about friction, and finally they discuss friction. These various activities provide students with experience with friction on several different levels which can make this term more accessible to students. However, I think that this term could have been more accessible to students if the teacher was to record a definition on the board of friction (for those students who learn visually). I also think that it is important that the teacher not only explain how to find the average distance that the cars rolled, but also explain what the average distance is. I am sure that there may be some students in that classes that have not heard that term before, therefore, I think it is important to ensure the students understand what that term means, and how it applies to their study on friction. In general, though, I thought that most of this lesson made scientific terminology accessible to most students. I think, however, that it is important to modify the lesson if the teacher may have English Language Learners, or students with special needs that may require more support.

During my interview with A, I had her perform and explain several math problems involving decimals. I was interested to see how much she understood about place value and if she could use her knowledge about place value to explain how she approached problems involving decimals. The first task asked how many one dollar bills you can get for a ten dollar bill, and then how many dimes you can get for ten dollars. For the next task, I asked A to order eleven numbers (1.42, .63, 5, .5, .05, .02, .6, .50, 1, .678, and .61) and explain how she decided on her order. Then I asked if she could come up with a number between .6 and .61. Lastly, I asked her if she could do the multiplication problem .3 x .7 and explain both the algorithm she used and why the product, .21, is smaller than either of the numbers she multiplied.
A was confident and calm throughout the interview. She explained her solutions very thoroughly and was able to effectively communicate her ideas and methods. At the end of the interview, A told me she thought it was fun and I think she enjoyed working on problems that were challenging or different for her. She struggled with her reasoning on the last problem (why the solution to the problem .3 x .7 was smaller than the multiplicands), but she tried to think about it from different perspectives and represent her answer in different ways for almost ten minutes! A had a great attitude and was very willing to try all of the tasks I put before her.
A comfortably reads, writes, interprets and compares decimals in the tenths and hundredths places, which is a fourth grade content expectation (N.ME.4.18). She can also relate these decimals to money and explain the relationships between digits in the ones, tenths and hundredths places (N.ME.04.15, N.ME.05.08). We worked with a couple numbers in the thousands place, and Amelia seemed comfortable with these as well. A correctly ordered all of the decimals I provided her and explained that "when you have decimals, the number that is first is the tenths place and then the second place is the hundredths place and the third place is the thousandths place. When you're in whole numbers, hundreds is more than tens, but with decimals, tenths is more that hundredths, so even if you had .0578, .5 would still be bigger because it's like saying 5000 is bigger than 578." She knew that .5 and .50 were the same number and correctly explained that "if you add zeros on, it will still be the same, but if you add zeros before something, it will actually change the number."
When I asked A if there was a number between .6 and .61, she said "probably." I asked if she could think of one, she struggled for a minute and told me that she couldn't. But when I reminded her of what she had told me about adding zeros on to the end of decimals, she saw that "you could think of it as 600 and 610, so you just have to think of something between 0 and 10." She wrote down .601. Continuing on this point, I asked if she could now think of a number that was greater than zero, but less than any other number on the list we were using. She quickly responded with "0.0005" and explained that, "when you add the zero before the number, it makes the number smaller. If I added more than one zero, because we only have one zero in these, the number will be smaller."
A correctly uses the standard algorithm for multiplying decimals and is developing an understanding of why the algorithm works. In the Everyday Math curriculum, students are not taught the standard algorithm (count the decimal places, multiply the decimals like they are whole numbers, place the decimal in the product) until 6th grade. The Michigan GLCE's state that students should be able to multiple a decimal by a whole number in fourth grade and a decimal by another decimal in sixth grade. A is already using the standard algorithm to multiply a decimal by another decimal! She approached the problem with ease and succinctly explained the algorithm. "I take out the two decimals and make a little note to remind myself how many decimal places there are. I just do the math problem without the decimals and then put in the decimal. I did two decimal places because I took out two. But if it was .3 by 7, it would be 2.1 instead of .21."
When I asked A why she got a smaller number when she multiplied the two numbers together, she explained the algorithm to me again. "I had to put the decimal place it two spaces, so it makes the number smaller." I wanted to see if she could explain the concept behind multiplying decimals, so I asked if she could think of a way to represent the math -- .7 x .3 = .21 -- to a younger student who hadn't learned the procedure she used yet. She thought of using base 10 blocks to represent seven tenths three times, which give you "21 tenths" she explained. The problem she was actually showing was .7 x 3 = 2.1 (or "21 tenths"). In her attempts to explain the math, she showed that she knew multiplication was repeated addition and tried to show that you could take .7 three times or .3 seven times to get .21. Since the math curriculum so far has only focused on multiplying a decimal by a whole number, her interpretation of the problem makes sense. She hasn't yet seen or learned about multiplying numbers between 0 and 1, so her thinking about these concepts and their relationships to other multiplication problems is still developing.

Over the semester, I have grown significantly in my ability to attend to and commit to the learning and achievement of all students. This is something I did not consider at the beginning of the term when I thought about teaching mathematics and now is something that is always at the forefront of my mind. I have become more aware of issues of equity in the classroom and now consider ways to combat inequity in my lesson plans.
In the first class assignment (page eight of my notebook), the things I thought important to consider at the beginning of the year included what my students know (prior knowledge), what I am required to teach by the district and state, what concepts I will teach, what teaching method I will use, and what my learning outcomes for students will be. I did not consider how to differentiate my teaching to reach individual students or how to "level the playing field" so that no student holds an advantage over others. I considered math to be the universal language to which every student has equal access.
By the second class assignment (page fourteen of my notebook), I thought it important to consider building a classroom community where students are free to explore ideas and take risks in a respectful and supportive environment. This is an important step in committing to the learning and achievement of all students, as a supportive classroom environment must not favor some students over others. Race, gender, and ability cannot be issues that affect the way others or I treat students and their work. However, I still was unable to consider how the problems I presented to my students might hinder some from learning and achieving. I said the types of problems I present is important to consider at the beginning of the year, but only so far as how they lead students to achieve the learning goals I have set. At this point, I still did not think about how problems and contexts can give some students an advantage over others.
The sixth class assignment (page forty-two of my notebook) shows how I learned to consider differentiating instruction by pairing students of different abilities and using multiple representations when solving a single problem. These practices help all students benefit from instruction, as they are receiving additional help when they need it and are shown multiple ways to solve the same problem. Using multiple representations is a good way to reach a group of students with various learning styles and ways of thinking.
During my mini-problem, I supported participation of all students by calling on a majority of my students and publicly valuing their contributions to the discussion. I used phrases like, "So you agree with Emily," naming the person who offered the idea we were discussing. I also provided a problem that was not situated in a context with which some students might be unfamiliar. This helped to ensure that all students had access to the mathematics central to our discussion.
The eighth class assignment (page fifty-eight of my notebook) includes my first attempt at analyzing how a supplied lesson plan addresses the learning and achievement of all students. When analyzing the fourth grade Everyday Math lesson about comparing and ordering decimals, I was able to consider how the tasks do or do not support the learning of all students and how the context may affect individual students. I was also able to identify what vocabulary, representations, and skills students are assumed to possess.
The tenth class assignment (page seventy-six of my notebook) shows improvement on my ability to analyze a lesson plan for issues of equity. When analyzing the third grade Everyday Math lesson about equal shares and equal groups, I was able to consider how the learning of all students was affected by the tasks and their progression, the examples used in the lesson, the context of examples and problems, the representations and tools used, and the language used. My knowledge of how the lesson supported or failed to support all students was more sophisticated and inclusive than the previous lesson analysis. I was able to see how all students might be affected by each of these areas and paid particular attention to how the context of the examples and problems may give a student an advantage over others. In the lesson, pennies offered a general context all students should be familiar with, but some students could have needed help understanding what "band members" were or what an "array" was in a mathematical sense. Leveling the playing field so that all students have equal access to the math is important.
In planning my math lesson, I took my lesson analysis skills a step further and adapted my lesson plan to avoid issues of inequality. In particular, I attended to knowledge students were assumed to have and modified the lesson to include a review of these vocabulary words and concepts. I wanted to ensure that each student was on board with the vocabulary we would use to discuss the new concept before moving forward. I also supported the participation of all students during the discussion. I called on students boy-girl-boy-girl as much as possible to ensure equality between genders and called on students with a wide-range of abilities. This meant I needed to ignore the hands of some of my higher-achieving students at times to hear what others had to say. I supported students' acquisition of a new vocabulary word ("tessellation") by connecting it to words they already knew ("tiling", "congruent", "no holes", etc.). As a result, my end-of-class check showed that most students had some understanding of the new term.
Overall, I made significant progress in the area of committing to the learning and achievement of all students. I began the semester without any thoughts about equity and how to ensure equity in my own classroom. As the weeks progressed, though, I started considering practices that would help all of my students learn the material and achieve the learning goals I set. These practices included strategically pairing students with different abilities, using multiple representations in a single problem, and creating a supportive classroom environment. By the second half of the semester, I was able to recognize biased contexts and to support equal participation in my classroom discussions. I was also able to analyze lesson plans for ways they supported or failed to support the learning of all students. I ended the semester with the skills necessary to analyze a lesson plan for strengths and weaknesses related to equity and the ability to adapt the lesson plan to address the learning and achievement of all students. This course has changed the way I look at equity in the classroom and has given me the tools to assess the way lesson plans and my own teaching help all students learn and achieve. This is something I now consider when planning lessons in math and all other subject areas. My classroom will not be a classroom where teaching practices reproduce inequalities but a classroom where the teacher considers the equity of all students in daily decisions.

In the beginning of this course, I was equipped with minimal strategies for ensuring that each and every student in my classroom will succeed in mathematics. I knew that it was important to provide students with equal opportunities; I understood that managing and maintaining a classroom of individuals was a necessary consideration in planning and enacting lessons. Through the work in this course, I was able to acquire specific strategies and approaches that will help me to develop equitable opportunity for all of my students.
In September, one assignment was to read Chapter 5 in our Classroom Discussions text, which outlined "solution methods and problem-solving strategies." I took note of these specific strategies and gave summaries of each, but I was unable to put the strategies into practice until much later in the term. In the same assignment, I read "Addition and Subtraction" by Carpenter and reflected in my notebook upon the main themes and ideas that coursed throughout both texts.
My response was general and vague; what strategies did I mean? What does an "ineffective strategy" look like? Generalizations such as creating equal opportunities for students based on the different ways students approach mathematics are present in my reflection, but in September, I was unable to articulate the different ways that I can build upon students' ideas and coax their confidence as mathematical thinkers.
A renewed understanding of ways to commit to the achievement of all students came with the student interview(s) I enacted mid-semester. Having to conduct two interviews was a hidden blessing; I became more aware of the vast differences between my two students in the way that they approached math. Developmentally, the two students were about equal; they had a good grasp of a one-to-one correspondence between numbers and objects and the basic strategies for addition and rebundling. However, when I presented more difficult tasks, the outcomes were very different for the two students. These interviews helped me to realize that in my lessons, I must attend to the existing ideas students have about mathematical concepts in order to build their knowledge, and I must do this in ways that encourage all students to learn.
Another way in which I have grown in the area of committing to the learning and achievement of all students is in my analysis of student errors. In class, our first analysis of errors was in subtraction, and my responses were, again, vague: "While it is difficult to see the students' thought process with this problem, it is clear that the student does not have a clear grasp of what answer would make sense." My analyses of errors in division were more developed and less presumptuous; I approached each problem under the assumption that each student went through the problem in a way that made sense to them, and that I could uncover the meaning behind errors rather than just point out the obvious mistake. The circulating assignment also helped me to record and reflect on students' individual responses to problems. I noticed that many of the students seemed disengaged from the math work, either working hurriedly to finish or working nonchalantly and in a disconnected way, while other students were treating the workbook problems as carefully and meticulously as they could. My records allowed me to look back and see much more than what students accomplished; they show me the students' individual attitudes toward math, and they show me ways that I can best attend to each of their individual needs as a teacher.

The most important criteria in determining the strength of my lesson is whether or not my students learned. In order to determine whether my students met the learning goals of this lesson, I will select a base of worksheets which seem representative of the entire group and analyze them in relation to the learning goals. As a reminder, the learning goals for this lesson are:
In terms of learning goal two, I analyzed this knowledge through an informal verbal assessment. Specifically, during the introduction we had a whole-class discussion as to the purpose for studying clouds and their shape. Here, we came to the conclusion that meteorologists study clouds in order to predict and analyze the weather. Later, during the conclusion of the lesson, we revisited this comment by discussing what we did for science and why. Although not all students specifically stated this purpose, they either gave their own reasonable purposes or a purpose related to that formed in the introduction. Therefore, I have concluded that students did achieve learning goal two.
In terms of learning goals one and three, I analyzed this knowledge through a formal assessment within my worksheet. On the student worksheet, I asked children to make their own observations in the spaces allotted as we skimmed through the projections. This would achieve learning goal one in that students were given the opportunity to list their own characteristics of each of the three basic cloud types. However, they were not given any guidance as to what to look for during these observation periods and therefore most observations were not related to the characteristics of the cloud itself. For example, student one wrote observations such as: there are shapes out of them, light blue, and kind of cloudy. Student two appears to have erased her initial observations and replaced them with those written on the chart paper. She wrote: wispy, puffy, and flat. Student three appears to have made the single observation: I see pictures. Later in the lesson, we had a whole-class discussion about the names and characteristics of each type of cloud. Then, students were expected to record and list these on their worksheets. This would achieve learning goal one in that students were given the opportunity to list characteristics of each of the three basic cloud types. Most students listed the cloud-type and their characteristics together (cirrus-wispy, cumulus-puffy, stratus-flat), which would facilitate the association process. For example, students one and two wrote the name and characteristic together in a format such as: cumulus puffy, cirrus wispy, stratus flat. From this evidence, I would conclude that students have learned that there are, in fact, different types of clouds, but are only in the beginning stages of matching cloud type with their defining characteristics.
During the conclusion of the main lesson, students were asked to identify the cloud-type depicted in a fourth projection and explain why they reached their particular conclusion. This would achieve learning goal three in that students would apply their learning about cloud types as evidence during a formal assessment. Students were allowed to use the information recorded on their worksheets and resources around the room to reach a conclusion. Students one, two, and three reached the conclusion that a cumulus cloud was shown on the projector, which is correct. However, only student one listed a reason for her answer by writing the word, puffy. So, although many students listed cumulus as their answer, most did not list a reason for their response. From this evidence, I would conclude that students have learned how to apply observations in order to formulate answers, but have not learned how to explain their answers using evidence. Such limited explanations could also be due in part to a lack of emphasis on this task and a limited capacity to put thoughts into words.

The grade level that I instructed was 1st grade, and I taught 4 groups of about 6 students each. I did my small group lesson plan as one of the centers over two days. I had the luxury of using my first two days as preparation for my final in which I taught my focus child. The objectives of my lesson plan were to get my students to use their imagination, prior knowledge, and personal experience when reading text, in other words to get the students to apply visualization in order to better understand text. They will increase their comprehensive abilities by using an alternative and possibly more challenging piece of work in this activity.
I started the lesson by telling the students about what we will be doing in the lesson and how it helps them as readers and listeners. The theme is to visualize the text that is being read; in this case it will be a poem about a river. Then I read the first poem, "The Wind", but stressed to them the importance of listening carefully and picturing what they hear. I modeled this behavior by telling them what good readers do when they listen to a poem and what to do when visualizing. After I read the poem, I asked the students what they imagined when heard the story. Then I showed them what I imagined by displaying the picture I drew from the poem. I explained to them that drawing a picture is a way to share their thinking and ask them to make their picture in their head before drawing it. Then I read the second poem, "Looking-Glass River", again stressing the importance of listening closely to the poem and picturing what is going on during the poem. I then had the students draw their pictures that they thought of during the reading. By modeling the assignment, the students got an idea of what they should be doing, but I made a specific choice not to make the poems similar so the students would use their own ideas.
My reason for devising this lesson plan was to give the students a separate and perhaps more difficult activity to a) analyze their literary comprehension skills, particularly my focus student and b) provide a new way of bringing poetry to the students. They typically have a poem that they cut out and paste into a writing journal, then draw pictures from the poem. Some of the poems they have read have pictures that assist their comprehension, but this lesson is the next step in scaffolding and will not have any illustrations to help. The skill that the students learned was visualization. This tool makes it easier for students to relate to text. This activity specifically helped my focus student because he is struggling with textual comprehension. He can identify words on a page and read them, but he lacks the ability to comprehend the words he has read.
The only way I could assess whether the students did well with the lesson or not was whether their drawings even remotely reflected the poem that we read. When looking at the pictures closely, many of the students did a great job with their visualization of the poem. However, my focus student did not do well with it. Instead, he drew a picture of the Holland flag, half submerged in water, because after all, the poem was about a river. In retrospect, I think the poem was a little above their heads and that perhaps since the poem was of a higher level of reading, it may have been far exceeding the level of comprehension for my focus child since he is ESL.
I believe that the finished product that the students handed to me was such that the students knew that their pictures were not based on "correctness" but rather a gauge of how they understood the lesson plan. This encourages a mastery goal orientation for the children because they know that the focus is on improving their abilities to understand text with out pictures. I made this decision because I didn't want students to simply draw what they think I want them to; I wanted the students to really try and use their own experiences in their work and delve into their own minds in order to produce a visualization that accurately depicts the text from the poem.
The second decision I made was to model the picture that I wanted them to draw, so the students had some semblance of an idea of what I wanted them to do. When I showed them my drawing that was based on the first poem, I made sure to point out which points of the poem were portrayed in my picture, and what I visualized. This method of modeling is the first step towards scaffolding, or gradually releasing the responsibility of learning onto the student. This is one of the most effective methods of teaching because it allows students to see how to correctly perform the activity, then it allows them to perform on their own with an idea of how to do it.
The final important decision I made was to make this lesson a comprehensive lesson plan. I am trying to reduce the amount of extrinsic help that the students receive when reading text; so if I increase their abilities to understand text on their own, with out asking for assistance, than we've made the first step in eliminating any kind of extrinsic influence. This decision to implement a comprehensive lesson plan gave the students the first step in the right direction towards becoming self-sufficient readers.

Unlike many other versions of this famous Shakespearean play, Roman Polanski did not intend to incite sympathy for MacBeth, but rather preferred to emphasize the barbarity and ruthless violence of the title character through his use of disturbing visual imagery and voiceover. Many of MacBeth's soliloquies express his inner torment and emotion so as to garner the favor of the audience. But in Polanski's version, most of these speeches are inner monologues that are portrayed through voice over, so that it is obvious that these thoughts are only inside MacBeth's mind, and are not intended for anyone else to hear. In this regard, MacBeth appears as a more immoral character when he does not vocalize his lamentations, because by keeping them in his own head, he is not making his regrets real. They are confined only to his own imagination. Polanski's take on MacBeth thus highlights the depravity of this overly ambitious man, in that his black and deep desires remain to rot within himself. This scenario is repeated in the beginning after MacBeth is pronounced "prince" by the rightful king, and also after MacBeth receives news of the impending English force, as he paces the castle while surrounded by his followers.
Polanski utilized the tactic of inserting disturbing visual images such as a severed hand, rape, animal fights, bloody corpses, etc. in order to add a more macabre tone to the film. By doing this, he overshadowed any goodness that Shakespeare may have originally intended for the play. In Polanski's world of Shakespeare, MacBeth is not a victim of ambition, but rather, an embodiment of the violent consequences of ruthless ambition.
Several scenes add an eerie and supernatural feel to the film, such as the scene in which MacBeth enters the dining room only to find the table full with visitors. But something is not quite right, and Polanski elicits the viewer to notice this by holding the shot for longer than normal. What we notice after this unnatural length of view is the grey figure of the slain Banquo seated in the middle of the table, his back facing MacBeth. What ensues is a horrifying and hallucinatory scene in which MacBeth stumbles backwards, and while shouting, becomes a small figure in the middle of the steps. MacBeth is in the middle/bottom of the camera screen, and his figure is dwarfed by the large setting behind him as the camera pans out. On the other hand, the image of the dead Banquo is now disfigured and covered in blood and floats above the ground. His figure appears larger than life (or death, ha ha) as the camera shoots his figure as a close up from below. The transition between these two visual images insinuates how weak and vulnerable MacBeth is to overpowering supernatural torment of his own mind.
I believe that Polanski's interpretation of MacBeth captured an essence of the original work that is sometimes obscured by the humanity that many interpretors try to attribute to the title character. Polanski did not try to attribute all the blame and evil to Lady MacBeth, but rather attributed equal guilt (if not more) to MacBeth himself. With the explicit violence and gory images, Polanski successfully highlighted the brutality of ambition and the evil inherent in uncompromising individualistic gain. This blatant carnage added a supernatural feel to an almost natural film.

Modern cinema possesses the ability to present Shakespeare in ways that contemporaries of the Bard could only dream of. But with greater artistic scope comes greater variation in the interpretation of the texts, such as found in Julie Taymor's Titus, adapted from Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus. Taymor chooses to create a Shakespearean realm where Roman times blend with the modern age in a game-like arena. Taymor uses this game-type world to play with cinematic perspectives by inserting a young boy from the modern age as a third party observer, eventually bringing him into the narrative by assigning him the role of Titus' grandson. The boy allows for the audience to become aware of its viewing presence, reminding us that this ostentatious display of violence and revenge is staged for our viewing pleasure. It is like a game in which we lose ourselves, but are occasionally taken back to our position as spectator.
How does the final act of Titus Andronicus blend the stage and cinema, the game sphere, and modernity? What tools does Taymor use in order to create this surreal environment? The dinner scene perhaps best illustrates the use of cinema as subject. The final act begins with the two grotesque cannibalistic pies cooling in a window sill, a scene that harks back to 1930s America, complete with upbeat jazzy music. The entire scene is quite theatrical, as Titus makes his grand entrance dressed as a chef to serve his guests their deadly dinner. During the moment when Lucius kills the emperor, the entire theatrical dinner is suddenly paused while the camera, in a fashion reminiscent of The Matrix, swivels around this moment frozen in time. The guests are then abruptly transplanted back to the Roman amphitheatre in which the movie began. We now see an audience composed of seemingly "real" and modern people, who look on detachedly from the horrible scene of carnage before them. Reading Donaldson's article, I learned that this audience was Croatian -- people who recently experienced one of the most violent and barbaric wars known in recent history (The Wars of Yugoslav Succession).
This final act showcases the all of the components in this unreal world: the cinema, the theatre, reality and modernity, and the game sphere. Both the boy, who has been the symbol of the viewer, and the addition of a real audience, which slaps us in the face to remind us of our viewing presence, now place the actors and the cinema as the focus of the film. The film itself has become the subject as all three audiences watch together, simultaneously. Together, we all watch on -- in horror and detachment -- as the carnage finally concludes with brutal on stage murders of four primary players. The beauty in the film is the violence itself, and how by using the cinema as the subject, Taymor is able to allow her audience to consciously watch the ensuing violence in a manner that both appalls and entertains. She makes a mockery of the brutality by showing how ridiculous and barbaric it is when we are able to watch from this perspective.

After reading The Odyssey, an epic Greek poem written by Homer, one is left with an interesting overall impression of the main female characters. The common characteristic which personifies most, if not all of the female characters, such as Penelope, Helen, Calypso, the Sirens, and Circe is that of deception. Each female character is able to effectively deceive other male characters, with the use of one or all of the following: weaving, potions, and spells. Particularly what interests me about Book Ten of the Odyssey is the portrayal of Circe as a witch, and the characteristics Homer uses to personify her as such. It is important to examine how Homer structures Circe's character because, "the Homeric portrayal of Circe is of great importance, for it may be considered the first extant portrait of a witch in Greek literature" (98, Ogden). By examining the description of the encounter between Odysseus and Circe, it is evident that Homer uses weaving, potions, and spell casting, to build Circe's character as a witch. (How circe fits in with other examples of deceiving women in the odyssey)
From the very first moment the reader meets Circe, she is performing an act which illustrates her true cunning and mischievous nature. Odysseus' men first encounter Circe in her home where they "heard her singing, lifting her spellbinding voice as she glided back and forth at her great immortal loom, her enchanting web a shimmering glory only goddesses can weave" (X, 242-46, Homer). In ancient Greece the act of weaving was considered a female role, and typically represents the deceptive nature of women. Weaving takes a great amount of forethought and planning, much like that which is necessary in order to lay a trap for them. In Circe's case her weaving foreshadows the trap she has set for Odysseus' men who are about to consume poisonous food. Also, the literal weaving is symbolic of a net or web which are both objects used to capture things, thus symbolic of Circe's plan to capture the sea men. This notion of weaving as a deceptive tool is furthered throughout the Epic by other female characters, like Penelope. Unlike in Circe's case in which the weaving is merely a clue to the reader that Circe is a deceptive character, Helen's weaving is her deception. Helen is able to fight off the suitors demand for her to take a new husband by claiming she will make a decision once she is done with her weaving. However, "by day she'd weave at her great and growing web... by night she would unravel all she'd done" (X, 115-17, Homer).

In Living for the Revolution, Kimberly Springer examines five black feminist organizations and interrogates the question of what constitutes a "woman's issue." Just as women of color and working-class women often had to create their own groups to address the issues they were concerned with, so too have black feminist historians had to write books to include these movements in the historical record. Springer notes that even the "wave" formation of historical feminist movements has been centered on white women (p. 8). She points out the call by black feminist historians to include the resistance of nineteenth-century bondswomen as an early form of feminist opposition, and also notes the fact that many black women -- such as Claudia Jones and Amy Jacques Garvey -- were actively fighting for social justice during an era when it was assumed by white women that feminist organizing was at a standstill. Clearly, continuing to utilize the categories of feminist waves is another way to silence the voices of women who have already been ignored in feminist history. Another point related to slavery that came up in both books concerns the notion during the Black Power movement that black men had been further brutalized and humiliated under slavery than black women had, and therefore black women ought to take a backseat role while supporting "their" men (Breines, p. 51, Spring p. 47). After reading so many works about the treatment of bondswomen, and the sexual abuse they often suffered, it's difficult to understand such statements -- clearly they were uttered before today's black women's historians had entered the academy, and their work has helped to correct such ideas. While the notion of emasculation is central here, this very concept is misogynist and implies that for a man to be feminized is the worst fate that could fall upon him. Why was there no call during Black Power for men to discuss how badly slavery had brutalized black women as well? Was this due to the masculine rhetoric of nationalism? Both books give examples of how assumed stories of historical events can both affect collective memory as well as current treatment of people. Just as the wave analogy serves to continue to marginalize women of color fighting gender oppression, the 1960s assumption that black men suffered more during slavery served to rationalize black women's modern day subordination.
Springer raises another point in her discussion of The Third World Women's Alliance concerning the rhetoric of black nationalism. The collective wrote in Triple Jeopardy, "Now we noticed another thing. And that is, with the rise of nationalism and the rejection of white middle class norms and values, that this rejection of whiteness...took a different turn when it came to the Black woman (p. 48)." This shows the keen analytical eye of the collective, for if white middle-class ideology upheld the nuclear family and traditional gender roles, would not a disparagement of this normative way of life also call for an alternative form of gender relations? Why was white men's tradition of protecting and subordinating "their" women replicated in black nationalist rhetoric? Couldn't there be space for women to raise children as well as lead on the frontlines?
After reading these books together with the articles on women in the Black Power movement a few weeks ago, it appears that among historians there is a debate around whether black women came to black feminism on their own, or through the positive or negative influences of white women and black men. On one hand, there appears to be the hope of historians that black women came to gender analysis on their own without the impetus of white women, but on the other, there is the notion that in the mid-60s, feminism was construed as a privileged critique only made by white women, as evidenced in the letter written by two white women in SNCC. However, movements and organizations always begin in reaction to events already in play; they do not form in a bubble, and acknowledging the events and ideologies of groups with more privilege that helped instigate the movement doesn't weaken the legacy of black feminism.
Springer does a great job of revealing the heterogeneity not only of black feminists but also of their various organizations. Clearly, the Combahee River Collective, with its commitment to socialism and visible lesbian leaders, was construed as the most radical, while groups such as the National Black Feminist Organization were sometimes referred to as "the black NOW." Noting this, it's interesting that even the NBFO garnered more support outside of the black community than within it (p. 52). How did mainstream black attitudes against black feminism different from mainstream white attitudes against white feminism? As is the case with most radical movements, clearly the mainstream press, as evidenced by the coverage in Jet and Encore, played a part in instilling the notion that black feminists were lackeys for white women, among other inaccuracies. The larger question might be, why was black feminism viewed as threatening to the black community during this era? Was this primarily due to the image of the black matriarch that the Moynihan Report summoned, and the fact that both black nationalists and the black mainstream saw black feminists as upholding such a supposedly negative image?

SAE 2004 World Congress was held in March 8-11, 2004, in Cobo Center, Detroit, Michigan USA, with the slogan, "The premier society dedicated to advancing mobility engineering worldwide." In the session of Safety Test Methodology (Part 3 of 3, Session Code: B15) that was planned by Occupant Protection Committee / Automobile Body Activity, the presentation of "Proposed Upgrade to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 202-Head Restrains: Methodology and Equipment" by the speaker, Helen A. Kaleto1, was interesting because this paper proposed modifications and enhancements of the current FMVSS, "Head Restraints." According to her, the current standard which was established in 1971 and last amended in 1998, needs to be supplemented to prevent or reduce the frequency of whiplash injuries which occur as a result of the movement of the head and neck relative to the torso. From the description and comparison of the current requirements and the proposed, it was shown that the proposed requirements enhanced current safety requirements and established new criteria. For the dynamic sled test, one of two test options to evaluate products upon the standard, for example, the current standard requires the head reference line with respect to torso reference line to be less than 45°, while the proposed requires it to be less than 12° for 50th percentile and 20° for 90th percentile of populations. Also, width requirements were newly proposed for the dynamic sled test. For the static rearward moment test, the other method of evaluation, which is preferred by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), dynamic component tests were added so that criteria for energy absorption, height retention, displacement, backset strength, and dynamic sled were newly introduced, while criteria for head rest location, height, head rotation removal, and dynamic sled were modified. All criteria were accompanied by introduction of test equipment and test description, so that it would be easy to set up a test. The proposed requirements would upgrade the current standard by requiring head restraints to be higher, closer to the head, and be available in front and rear outboard positions. She said that the final rule was expected to be released by Sep. 1. 2004, thus, vehicle produced after sep. 1. 2007 would have to meet this requirement. Until then, either of current FMVSS 202, the Economic Commission for Europe Regulation No. 25 (ECE-25) plus 202A width requirement, or FMVSS 202A (proposed) should be satisfied, which allows to predict modifications to the new requirements and test procedures. She added that the final rule would be a challenge for industry, both from a design and test perspective, which could be a drawback of the proposed requirements. This paper was along the line with other papers in terms of dealing with safety test methodology, and similar to focus on drivers' safety as same as Patel2 and Paulitz3, which was different from Deb, et al4 that considered pedestrian impact testing and Rehkopf5 that dealt with material characterization testing.
Another presentation by Biren J. Patel2, in the same session, identified 11 rollover resistance test methodologies and 9 rollover performance test methodologies in his paper, such as drop test, corkscrew test, ditch test, soil trip, and numerical modeling. It seemed that test methods had not been guaranteed technically so far and needed to be identified and standardized. The presentation by Dirk Paulitz3 was about door latch. In the paper, applied force to a door latch during rollover was analyzed based on component analysis of a latch, and vulnerability of door latches to rollover induced loads was tested for several cars. This paper seemed to be a lab oriented study which required strong backgrounds in dynamics. The other two presentations were "Effects of Unloading and Strain Rate on Headform Impact Simulation" by Anindya Deb4, and "Material Behaviour for Modelling Bumper Impact" by Jackie D. Rehkopf5. These presentations addressed head interior and pedestrian impact testing, and material characterization testing and modeling. Throughout the presentations, auditors seemed to be interested in what the speaker said, but not to be bothered to leave and come whenever they wanted to. Some questions asked after each of the presentation sounded planned and serious, and the general impression about the session was that it was quite formal so that it was not in a free mode for both sides (speaker and auditors) interacting during the presentation.
From the exhibition, helmet mounted display which detected head movement by an accelerometer, presented by United States Army NAC (National Automotive Center), was interesting. National Instruments (NI)'s 8-minute presentation/advertisement/tutorial of LabView followed by a lottery was exciting. NI's displace measurement system by vision information from a camera, even for a fast changing displacement, was impressive. VIA Information tools Inc. showed 3D printer that printed a 3D object made of powders, as well as providing a self-balancing two-wheel ride. Vicon Motion System presented the motion capture system that detected motion using light-reflectors as HUMOSIM had. A vision guided robot by Braintech was also interesting and I thought it would be useful in real factories. I enjoyed seeing new techniques/products and experiencing each of them. Compared to the technical session, the exhibition was more exciting, fun, friendly, and experiencing. However, some exhibitors seemed to hesitate to approach people around. I guess it is because they were not marketing people/sales representatives, but engineers. But they were much better at explaining the principle of their products. In general, it was a great experience, and it was special because it is the first professional conference I have ever been to.

Being efficient suggests bearing results with little or almost no wasted efforts while effectiveness means achieving goals which support the organization's objectives, with proper utilization of the resources. Thus an organization can either be effective or efficient or both. In terms of efficiency, I feel Omega ranks higher. Rawls stresses more on inter-departmental delegation and co-operation which doesn't limit a worker's skills to his domain. Rawls can thus underscore reliability and quality in his production. Acme's mechanistic structure can be justified by increased productivity and at the same time striving to be cost-efficient. Unarguably, Acme's annual sales ($10 million) were higher than that of Omega's ($8 million). John Tyler laid out a well-defined hierarchical and compartmentalized structure which possibly could have been the reason of Omega discovering the flaw and not Acme. Omega figures high in "effectiveness" as well since none of their proto-types were found to be defective unlike Acme's. Acme, I feel was not as efficient because of improper utilization of resources, a certain mechanical engineer who procrastinated and the assembly process being miscalculated on account of a single part being disassembled and put back many times. Acme's effectiveness was commendable, though, as it achieved its goals of delivering as promised, despite dire programming setbacks.
Acme operated under a mechanistic structure while Omega had a more decentralized organic structure which relied heavily upon teamwork and inter-departmental communication. Both of them operated in an unstable environment and a highly competitive market. The official goals of Acme and Omega were somewhat similar; meeting the production deadline, setting quality standards and minimizing the non-conformities or defects. They were after all, two paradoxical organizations competing in the same market and utilizing the same resources. Acme focused more on providing competitive costs.
The operative goals were different. Acme had established standard rules, which everyone was supposed to work according to and the internal efficiency of the organization played a key role. They had distinct departments which operated independently all in an effort to minimize the production delays. Each of the employees specialized in their own field and worked individually. Departments could not monitor each others' progress until the final assembly stage.
Omega gave more importance to the informal work atmosphere, with personnel from different departments coming together to consult each other. Rawls didn't advocate the memos and preferred to keep everything informal. The organization is so structured that every employee feels he is contributing to it. Contrary to Acme, Omega focuses more on delivering the product rather than how it is achieved.
Thus, Acme and Omega, despite having similar official goals differed in their operative goals.
Omega would lie in the 2nd quadrant and Acme in the 4th The implications of this would be that Omega is a much more flexible organization placing more emphasis on human resources and the focus being more on internal processes. Workers are not restricted to their domain. Acme is a profit-based goal driven organization which has high process control and standardization. There is a clear job-description. Planning and goal setting are given prime focus.
I would suggest the senior managers in Omega to adopt somewhat a mixed strategy. A goal oriented, cost efficient planning process. Their principles of organization turned out to have inherent flaws, as eventually they lost the deal to Acme. The job definitions in the organizations should be outlined more sharply but it shouldn't sacrifice the departmental co-operation. The president should exercise stronger control over the production processes. Resource acquisition and information management are some of the other areas where improvements can be advised. Being cost-efficient is the only way they are going to match up to other competitive organizations like Acme.

Feinberg and Reiman establish elegantly the optimality of randomized trunk reservation in a generalized M/M/c/N queue reward system, subject to a constraint on long-run average customers blocked. Once showing that there exists an optimal policy of the randomized trunk reservation form, they strengthen the claim by outlining a solution procedure via linear programming, and they also describe how an optimal randomized policy can be reduced to an equivalent optimal stationary policy. These reasons make their paper novel and significant.
First, it is essential that the reader (myself included) understand the structure of a randomized trunk reservation policy. In brief, such a policy
If we replace the last condition by requiring that
Now, a couple of notes about the model itself. The authors formulate the problem as maximizing the long-run average reward subject to rejecting no more than a certain proportion of type 1 customers. Type 1 customers are of interest because they carry a reward that is at least as large as that of any other customer type. It should be noted that the authors obtain nice properties for the transition probabilities because of their use of purely Markovian arrival and service distributions, and moreover, that the service distributions are i.i.d. Without making this assumption, the paper would become immensely more complex and would lose some intuitive value.
The second section of the paper recycles an earlier paper by Feinberg to show that for every feasible such problem (i.e. the rejection criteria is not too sensitive) there exists a 1-randomized stationary optimal policy. This is the main crux of the section, but it also shows with less fanfare how to obtain the limiting probabilities for each state for a given policy. This identity is used repeatedly throughout the paper. One also finds in this section a nonlinear program whose solution yields a randomized stationary policy. This math program will be refined at a future point in the paper.
The third section is the heart of the paper. In it, the authors carefully construct a proof for the optimality of randomized trunk reservation, or of the equivalence of 1-stationary randomized optimal policies and optimal randomized trunk reservation policies. To prove the main theorem, they require a secondary theorem and four lemmas. The proofs are long and intricate, and a reader who wants to truly understand the paper would do well to study them. In essence, they show that a randomized stationary optimal policy cannot optimally nothave the properties of randomized trunk reservation that I outlined above.
I found the fourth section to be the most interesting and impressive. Based on the conclusion from the previous section that any stationary randomized policy has the property that type 1 customers are never rejected, they are able to greatly simplify the math program set forth in section two. Better yet, they are able to reduce the NLP to an equivalent LP simply by substituting a composite
Feinberg and Reiman conclude with three brief sections, the first of which handles a special case where m = 2 and the objective function is to minimize the long-run average number of type 2 customers rejected. The second proves how a 1-randomized stationary policy, which is deterministic in all states but one (say (n, j)) , can be simplified to a policy where uncertainty only exists the first time customer type j sees n customers in the system for each transition to state (
If I had to make any suggestions to the authors, I would have just two. First, it seems to me that the second section is quite disjoint from the rest of the paper, and its notation slightly confusing. Since it had already been published in a different paper, the authors could have cited the main results without such loss of continuity. Secondly, it is intuitively obvious, given the problem assumptions, that in an optimal policy, one would probably never reject type 1 customers. They bring the greatest reward, there is a constraint on the proportion of them rejected, and there is no discouragement (e.g. excessively long service times) from admitting them. I therefore question the choice of the constraint placing a restriction on type 1 customers. Indeed, it hardly seems a constraint! Perhaps the choice of a constraint could depend on the particular application of the SMDP presented in this paper. Nevertheless, I thought the paper was excellent.

I have chosen to examine the first two sections of Unit 1 of Spoken Urdu (ibteda'i urdu) Volume One originally published by the Institute for Islamic Studies at McGill University by Muhammad Abd-al-Rahman Barker, Hasan Jahangir Hamdani, Khwaja Muhammad Shafi Dihlavi and Shafiqur Rahman. This volume is divided into 15 units, each one of which contains 7 sections arranged in the following order:
In the introduction, the authors indicate that this book is a text for an intensive elementary course in written and spoken Urdu. The English and Urdu titles on the cover page have different meanings. The Urdu text is best translated as "Introductory Urdu" instead of Spoken Urdu. The Urdu title reflects the purpose of the book more accurately than the English. The authors do not consider this to be a good teach-yourself resource, rather it is designed as a resource for experienced language teachers who are familiar with basic linguistics. Roman text is used to phonetically spell out Urdu words instead of the Arabic script used to write Urdu.
The poor visual design of this book hinders the language learning task. The typeface used makes the text hard to read and the publishers have further aggravated this by using a small font size. They have not employed bold or italicized text for section headings or to distinguish words in vocabulary lists. Section headings are larger than the normal text and are set in capital letters. But the size difference is not readily apparent. This results in eye strain and makes it hard to navigate to specific points in the text. I have included a copy of pgs. 1 and 3 at original size to illustrate my point.
The first unit, like all the others, starts with the transcript of a conversation. The line of text immediately after the section heading describes the scenario, which is a conversation that takes place between between two people at a party. The characters are two professors which suggests that their interaction is somewhat formal. New Urdu words are defined in English before each line of the conversation. The English text is given on the left of the page and its Urdu equivalent is given on the right. This layout is cluttered and unintuitive. The Urdu text should be on the left and its English equivalents should be on the right. People who are fluent English speakers are used to looking at the unknown information before the explanations because of the way dictionaries and thesauruses have been formatted. The word definitions are confusing since the reader is expecting to read a conversation and sees a gloss instead. The same text is repeated in the first line of the conversation. The repetition of the text may be used to aid the memorization of the vocabulary, but it complicates the task of reading the conversation transcript.
The use of dialog is appropriate in the first chapter of the book since students cannot be expected to have a conversation using a flow diagram such as the one presented on pg. 122 of Cook. They have no Urdu vocabulary since they are presumably starting the course and so giving them a conversation they can read or possibly reenact can help them identify the phonological characteristics of the language. However, the particular conversation presented appears to be constructed. The scenario is easily imagined and can easily be adapted to a situation that the student may find herself in, but the tone is extremely formal. Some of the phrases used such as "mizaj sherif"? (How are you? ), which Dr. Rahim (the Pakistan professor) would not normally be used in conversation between two people at a party, even if they have just met. A student adopting and using such a phrase to open a conversation would appear quaint to the average Urdu speaker.
The glosses preceding each line in the dialog contain notes in square brackets in addition to the meaning of each word. These notes can provide helpful insight into the distinctions between the Urdu words and their English equivalents, but most of them are too brief to be useful. This information would be better placed in the oddly named Word Study section that follows the conversation. This section does not exclusively examine the individual words, it also provides information that the student may use to build an initial cultural schema. It The discussion of the appropriate greeting term (1.101) is overly strict in defining which greeting to use with Muslims and which one to use with Hindus. The dual purpose of this section results in it appearing unfocused. It would be better if it was divided into two different sections, one for the cultural information and the other one for the examination of words.
The authors have not provided and exercises or activities after either one of these sections. Asking some questions on the content of the dialog may have aided comprehension. This comprehension could have been further honed when combined with exercises utilizing the information presented in the Word Study section. As previously mentioned, all the chapters in this book follow the same format. The dialog becomes more complex with each chapter, but the format remains the same. As the student becomes better acquainted with the language and the culture, and as her vocabulary increases, the format of the chapters should be changed. Perhaps using a flowchart to guide a conversation or suggesting a topic for discussion instead of working with canned dialog would reduce the monotony of the learning process and make it more stimulating for both teacher and student.

When I was told I had to take a Linguistics course, immediately my heart plummeted as I thought about the various dialects and phonetic sounds that I would have to learn. Little did I know that there was more involved in the study of Linguistics. When I found Linguistics 386, I was a little skeptical about a class that actually sounded like fun but also could be considered a Linguistic course. However, I decided to sign up for it. The decision to take this course has significantly altered my career pathway as well as my outlook on service learning.
Once I started attending discussion and realized that this class may actually be as cool as I thought it would be, I was ready to find my site placement. Immediately after hearing I had the option of working with children, I knew without a doubt what site I was interested in volunteering with. After attending the volunteer informational and meeting heather Simms, I was ecstatic to start working in the classroom. However, after volunteering at the Northwood ELI classroom for over 13 weeks, there are still things that I find puzzling within the ELI classroom. Some examples include the politics of the classroom, the role volunteer's play and the importance of the magic box.
When I interviewed Heather about working as a language instructor, the conversation started getting strained as we began to talk about the politics of the classroom and loss of financial aid to the classroom. This confuses me because the University is known for its commitment to diversity and for them to cut back on a superb ELI program like this one does not back up their commitment. I am also puzzled by the role volunteers play within this program. Obviously, as a volunteer we are there to help out with the students in the classroom as well as support Heather as she teaches; my confusion comes from what happens after we leave. These students have gotten use to certain volunteers and for them to have to start working with new people disturbs me because I wonder if that disrupts their learning process. Finally, the last puzzler of my site placement is the magic box. As discussed in class and various reflection papers, the magic box is a game used in circle time to allow the students to practice their English as well as act as a guessing game. This box confuses me because I am unable to understand how such a simple game elicits such joy from the students. One of the things I like most about the box is that not only do the kids enjoy the activity but little do they know how much they are learning while playing the game.
Throughout my experience at the Northwood center, my perceptions on language have changed drastically. Ever since I got back from Argentina this summer, I knew that I missed out on my experience but I wasn't sure where this feeling came from. While volunteering at Northwood and participating in discussions within the classroom, I realize that the process of learning a foreign language requires not only patience as I previously thought but confidence as well. I pride myself on being a confident person no matter what but I realize now that when I spoke Spanish, my confidence goes away. Interestingly enough, in Argentina I had the opportunity to build my confidence up, but instead I shrank into a shell and stayed in my comfort zone and in a sense refused to learn the language. However, I learned the exact opposite about language teaching, a career path I am interested in learning more about after taking this class. I learned that it is definitely important to be patient while teaching but it is even more important to have fun. I honestly believe that if the games and activities were not fun then most of the Northwood students would still be at a beginning level of English.
As a result of my service-learning experience, I feel that I have significantly changed my view on people who are learning English as a second language. As Americans, we take it for granted because it is an item in our privilege backpack, but in fact English is a difficult language to learn. I also think more positively about the term service learning because I used to think of it as just community service but I feel that with service learning, volunteers take away a piece of the site with themselves as well as give back to the site. However, with community service you are simply giving back to the site.
As an overall assessment of the classroom atmosphere, I would have to say that I am very impressed. Sometimes we discussed sensitive issues such as whether or not we were really making a difference as volunteers because eventually we would just leave the students and go back to our own lives. Carolyn and Elizabeth allowed us to talk/work our way through this topic while adding their comments that would further discussion. I also liked the monthly individual meetings because were able to discuss readings with them as well as talk about our site placement. I think these meetings helped me more than discussion because it was one-on-one and we could discuss whatever it was that we were having difficulty with. I think that this was the best part of the class and should be implemented into all classrooms.

Eric suggested in class that pain fulfills criterion "E", the evaluative role that mental objects seem to have. Pain is not bad because we assign it the value "bad". It just is bad (intrinsically bad, I would assume).
However, it seems -- at least in some cases -- that pain is bad because of the value we assign to it. Consider the case of the devout Christian. The devout Christian views physical pain as a way to share in the suffering of Christ (indeed, Pope John Paul II spoke of his great physical suffering as a blessing). He considers his pain a good thing, because it allows him to meditate on the sufferings of Christ and therefore become a better Christian. Pain is not bad for the devout Christian. Use another example, if you like. For the hedonistic masochist, too, pain is not bad. It is a source of pleasure for him, and he does not consider what gives him pleasure to be bad.
Now, does this mean that those of us who consider pain to be intrinsically bad are really just assigning the value "bad" to pain? I do not know, and a one page paper hardly seems the place to discuss the question. If pain is not bad by assignment, then it fulfills the evaluative role. If pain is bad merely by assignment, though, it does not fulfill the evaluative role. This does not mean, of course, that pain does not have a place among the mental. Pain appears to play a behavioral role, it is "introspectible from the 'inside' "

Power exists, in form or another, in every human interaction we encounter on a daily basis. The power relationship that exists between people can be of dominance and subservience or a reciprocal relationship where powered is either shared equally or varies from situation to situation. In most cases, when there is a dichotomy of power between two individuals, behavioral differences can be observed. From my own experiences and noted observances, there is a marked difference in how people with power use their cellular phones over individuals who do not have as much power using a cell phone.
I'll begin with how people answer their phones. In this day and age, all cell phones have caller ID system, allowing receivers to easily know the number and person who is calling them before they answer. As a throwback to the days of just landline, many people still naturally answer the phone with the rhetorical "hello?" However, those with power, or those that want to exude more power, usually answer the phone first identifying the caller and asking the first question. By establishing that the receiver (who wants or has power) knows who is calling and is already asking something of the caller, dominance is established before the caller can even begin to explain why they called. Usually, this phenomenon would go unnoticed, because the receiver's question is not out of line with what the caller wants, but it's still establishing their superiority. For example, as president of a student organization on campus, I usually will answer my phone as "Hi (Caller) what's up?" or "Hey (caller) what do you need?" However, when my boss calls me, I always answer with the questioning "Hello?" even though I know who it is. But, I allow my boss the time to identify herself and then tell me at her convenience what she wants.
How an individual talks to someone on their cell phone is also telling of power relationships. Although social norms have been pretty well established as to when and where it's appropriate to talk on you phone in public, there is question as to how you act to the person who you're talking to. Clearly, cell phones are used for convenience and multitasking, in the car, at the store, while you walk, etc. I notice that others who are in positions of power over me are much more likely to interrupt our phone conversation to multitask, answer questions to people around them, or put me on hold as they take another call or deal with another issue. It seems natural to me that if someone is in a position of power over the other person on the line, they can more easily say "hold on,"
From my own experiences talking with other student leaders on campus, the closing of a cell phone conversation can also be a clue to the dominant individual in the exchange -- or, at the very least -- the person who is trying to establish more dominance. When closing a conversation, I've never liked it when people have stated "Listen, I'm going to have to let you go, but..." This shows their superiority in a conversation, that they're not only ending the conversation first, but they're establishing that talking with them was a privilege. In addition, it makes whoever makes that statement appear as though they are sacrificing for the other person on the line -- they're the one who's taking on the burden of wanting to hang up. In a reciprocal conversation, a much more common phrase would be "I'm sorry, I have to go..." or another statement which actually takes on the form acknowledging they either want or need to end a conversation.
Finally, I've observed that the amount of time it takes for a person to call individuals back can be a telling sign of relational power on the phone. With Caller ID and voicemail, everyone now knows who called them, how many times they called, and at what time they received the call. In that manner, those who have more power appear to be less likely to quickly return calls to people who have less power. Again, those with power would place a lower priority on calls from those not their equal or superior, and have no problem explaining that they were busy and got back to the caller as soon as they could. In example, people on my executive board or committee chairs for my student organization, they always are quick to respond to my messages. At times, I have a quick or needless question, and I do not leave a message at all, because it's not worth my time for them to call me back. But, sure enough, about 75% of the time, people will call me back without even listening to my message, eagerly wanting to know what I wanted, or will return my call even if I didn't leave them a message.
With the modernization and technological advances occurring in our society, the rules and standards of interaction are consistently changing. As it becomes quicker and easier to communicate between individuals, more and more subtle ways of establishing, developing, and challenging power in relationships are being created and observed. Through the salutation, body, closing, and even response time of cellular phone conversations, power is in existence and is being asserted. And, like any situation, the difference in behavior between one caller and the other show us the dynamics and interplay of power in these situations.

In watching the news and reading articles online I've found that our media is caught in a rut of advertising what is wrong with society. From women and their children being murdered to casualties in the war on terrorism, the sensationalist news coverage showcases a grim world. Much like traditional psychology, a lot of what people are shown in the news is the negative and the positive is left out of the show. Being a part of the Positive Psychology Seminar has been a breath of fresh air. Not only do we get to talk about the research being done to highlight the good in people, we get to be reaffirmed that we are among good people by sharing stories of ourselves at our best and acting in kind ways through out the semester. I've really enjoyed what we've been discussing thus far and I can't wait for the chocolate tasting :)
I had some trouble thinking of what to do for the "assignment" of performing a random act of kindness. I found that there were opportunities to do kind things for people I am friends with or those that might be able to figure out who the anonymous good-doer was, but it was more difficult to come up an original idea to help out someone I didn't know. Saturday night I found a small way. I went to the jazz quartet tribute to John Coltrane at Hill Auditorium that evening. Before the performance there was a speech and food provided to students as part of the Arts and Eats package. There was tons of pizza. Absolute tons. In the end, more pizza than the group there could ever eat. So we were offered boxes to take home. We had about 40 minutes before the show started so I grabbed a box and walked back to my dorm with wonderful dreams of solving my late night food cravings. When I arrived at South Quad there was a group of students sitting around that eyed the pizza box enviously. I heard one mention how hungry they were and how they were disappointed to recently find the cafeteria closed. With a slight twinge at the thought of losing my midnight snack I handed the kids my pizza and walked away.
While it wasn't something that necessarily helped anyone out in a huge way, it made a group of hungry kids happy. It felt nice to do something for someone else without expecting to see them again or to have a reciprocal favor. The feeling of doing something nice just for the sake of spreading a form of kindness felt very pure. I know a few people who often do nice gestures for their friends and loved ones but then expect to receive something in return, maybe not immediately, but usually by some point. This seems to mar the good act. It is no longer something you are doing for someone else, but a method for you to achieve something that you desire later; a kind of unfair situation for the person receiving the "random" act of kindness.
I believe the assignment also brought about an awareness of how to be a nicer person in general. I found myself thinking about what I could do for others each day, and although I didn't always act on the thought, I felt like I kept a more positive attitude through out the week.
I'm excited at the prospect that this course will have a strong influence on how I approach the world. For example, I'm conducting a research project this semester on motivation and testing and at first I wanted to look at what makes kids do poorly on these exams. After starting to look into the literature on the topic I've realized that I could also begin examining the subject from the opposite side, seeing what makes people succeed and what leads to resilience. Even if I don't fulfill that objective in my research directly, I'll at least have a new outlook from which to view the results. I'm looking forward to where this course will take all of us.

Glancing at the VIA Signature Strengths survey I thought there were only 24 questions. Honestly, I thought the 240 questions description in the introductory paragraph was a typo. Alas, I went through the survey and in the end I am glad that there were ten questions for each strength. In class we discussed how truthful the data from some of the other surveys could be, especially when a five-item questionnaire was supposed to show how satisfied with life a person is. This survey, despite its length, examined more aspects of each item and I found that a little more reassuring when the final results were displayed.
I was not surprised by my top strengths or my bottom strengths. I was a little more confused by my results for the middle section. Do I really have more optimism than love for learning? I think I have more gratitude than zest, at least sometimes. And why was my caution rating so low? I have always considered myself to be a fairly caution individual and to be careful when taking risks, not to jump into situations unprepared. As someone interested in quantitative psychology, I would have enjoyed seeing a scale for each response, similar to the other surveys we have taken. That way it would be easier to interpret how the scale measures each item and how much differently the strengths were rated. I felt that I had given pretty similar answers for some of the items and wondered if their ranking wasn't just arbitrary since they might have had the same overall score.
One aspect of the survey that I found very helpful was the description on the scores page. The last sentence, "your top five, especially those marked as Signature Strengths, are the ones to pay attention to and find ways to use more often," really struck out to me as a defining aspect of positive psychology. Focus on the positive! This statement reminded me of the article we read for this week, "The Felicity of Virtue". It correlates with the idea that it is easier and more productive to focus on your strengths and to start making yourself a better person by working on traits that you already possess. Instead of showing what your lowest strengths (seems like an oxymoron anyways...) are, the survey results displays the top five and urges the survey-taker to look at those and try to improve their daily life by using them more often.
In the same article the author concludes his first section by questioning whether the happiness hypothesis will be left to the cynic and to follow the Machiavellian and to fake it until you make it (pg. 158), roughly speaking using an AA saying and self-help guru mantra. While I think the rest of the article brushes off the idea that this is the future of becoming a virtuous person, it's an interesting position to consider. What are the benefits of faking it: you could be being nicer and helping others, other people could appreciate your efforts; you can start to examine your own mode of thinking and analyze your current actions; and you can practice a skill you want to master. To me, that doesn't sound too bad. Granted, you're being "fake" and "not real", but if the goal is to become a greater person, I think the means justify the ends.

If I were to describe myself I would say that I am energetic, friendly, and organized. To determine the accuracy of my description, I took a version of the Big Five personality model factors test that I found online. I was also curious if I had acquired my personality through the environment I was brought up in, or if it was genetic. In order to attempt to answer this question, I had both of my parents take the test as well as a stranger. The results of the tests allude to the facts that my personality is not my fault, just bad genes as well as I am just a product of my environment.
My results of the Big Five personality model factors test made me realize two things about my personality. The first was my score in the neuroticism category. This trait reflects the tendency to experience negative thoughts and feelings. High scorers are prone to insecurity and emotional distress and low scorers tend to be more relaxed and less emotional. As can be seen in Table 1, I received a low score. This was surprising to me as I expected to be in the average point range due to my tendency to become high strung in stressful situations along with doubting many decisions that I make daily. The second category that surprised me was my average rating in openness. This trait reflects "open-mindedness" and interest in culture. High scorers tend to be imaginative, creative, and to seek out cultural and educational experiences. Low scorers are more down-to-earth, less interested in art and more practical in nature. I would have thought of myself receiving a low score because I am in the engineering school which does not challenge the creative and art side of me as much as the down-to-earth, logical side. On the whole however, I believe that the Big Five personality model factors test was fairy accurate in how I would describe myself.
In order to find out how my personality was shaped, I asked my parents as well as a stranger to take the same Big Five personality test and send me their results which can also be found in Table 1. I found these results interesting for a couple reasons. To begin with, I have more personality traits in common with both parents than with the stranger. This can either be due to genetics or the environment in which I was raised. It does rule out the fact that all human beings are the same in their personalities. The more intriguing observation is the opposite nature of the personalities of my parents. This could stem from the fact that they were divorced some time ago and therefore have been able to form their own personalities unaltered by the constant presence of the other spouse. Table 1 shows all my personality traits match with either one parent or the other demonstrating a genetic correlation. Finally, I match more personality traits with my mother than with my father. This could be due to the fact that for the last four years I have been living mostly with my mother. This correlation provides support that personality is also a product of one's environment.
The role my environment plays in the formation of my personality could be due to both sibling contrast and split parent identification. Sibling contrast is when the siblings in a family tend to emphasize their differences instead of their similarities. This can be seen between the personalities of my brother and I. My brother is competitive, quiet, and reserved, whereas I am cooperative, outgoing, and friendly. He excels as sports and other competitive endeavors while I excel in making friends in social settings. Along with sibling contrast, split parent identification happens when one sibling is more like the mother while the other identifies strongly with the father. I can think of many traits such as patience and kindness that I have in common with my mother while my brother is mostly like my dad in that they are competitive and reserved. According to Peter Grey, I have accentuated different personality traits to reduce sibling rivalry that can be crippling to a family unit. Through my brief research concerning my own personality I have discovered that I am a product of my environment and also that my personality really isn't my fault but just bad genes.

The quality of spatial environments has serious implications for health at both an individual and collective level. Sociologists have demonstrated that the meso-level impacts health across the lifespan from birth weight (Morenoff) to mortality in elderly populations (Klinenberg). These effects are produced not by the individuals who inhabit different neighborhoods but by institutional and structural features of neighborhoods themselves. In a review of the literature on "neighborhood effects" and social processes, Robert Sampson, Jeffery Morenoff and Thomas Gannon-Rowley note that meso-level social problems are often interrelated. Poverty, crime, educational advancement, joblessness, and health interact dynamically—creating neighborhood "hot spots" where the sum total of these effects can often mean poor health at best and death at worst for those that inhabit them. 
Klinenberg describes how neighborhood factors combined to create a perfect storm for the elderly, urban, poor during the Chicago heatwave of 1995. The majority of these deaths were preventable simply by an air conditioner (and the ability to pay for its attendant costs). Yet, over 700 people died than normally do during this time of year. Social isolation resulting from neighborhood demographic changes, fear of the devastating financial and/or physical effects of crime in violent neighborhoods, lack of safe public spaces, and changes in the provision of social services resulted in the high death toll of seniors.
For example, seniors that lived in violent and even marginal neighborhoods were afraid to go out on the street because they knew that an attack, however unlikely, could result in death given their fragile health status. Along these lines, a robbery could have devastating financial consequences for those living on a limited income. Seniors that had access to shared public space that they perceived as safe where they could go to stay cool were more likely to survive. In this way, the conditions of the neighborhood had a clear causal influence on the whether a senior was able to survive the heatwave.
James Kirby's work further supports the link between health and spatial environments by demonstrating that access to health care is related to the rate of flux in neighborhood populations.
