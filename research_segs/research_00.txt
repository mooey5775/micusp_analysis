Drosophila melanogaster, or the common fruit-fly, offers the geneticist a near perfect organism to explore the models of inheritance via simple, straight forward, cross breeding experiments. Short living -- with a fast generation time -- easy to handle and maintain in cultures and female only cross-over events, make D. melanogaster most desirable in the lab. As result much is known about the fruit flies genome; however, on occasion new mutations are discovered and experimentation is undertaken to determine the exact genes involved in these new mutants.
A true breeding culture of Drosophila, dubbed U-5343, is an example of such a scenario. The flies exhibit three genetically controlled novel phenotypic traits: black bodies, terminating pre-margin longitudinal veins LII and LIV, and white eyes. Ascertaining the nature of these mutations is an interesting problem and useful to the study of genetics in general. To answer questions, such as: what are modes of inheritance (dominant/recessive/sex-linked/autosomal); how many genes are involved; and, where are the genes located -- cross breeding experimentation was undertaken. Specifically, five initial crosses and five secondary crosses were preformed in hopes of answering these questions.
Two of these initial crosses were reciprocal crosses. Cross A (unknown virgin female x +type male) and Cross B (+type virgin female x unknown male) were done to determine if the genes are recessive or dominate and sex-linked or autosomal. The secondary crosses, F1xF1 of Cross A and F1xF1 of Cross B, were done to determine: the number of genes controlling the trait; these genes interaction, if multiple present; the segregation ratios for each gene; independent assortment between genes, by a χ2 test; and, the map distances between linked genes. Answering these questions was accomplished by scoring flies of both F1 and F2 generations of the two crosses.
Cross I (unknown virgin females x M-I males) and F1xF1 of Cross I were done to determine the relationship between the genes and the X-chromosome. The specifics of the marker type can be found in the MATERIALS AND METHODS section, however, these crosses were potentially helpful to determine if the genes are on the X-chromosome and, if yes, where they are located. Again, scoring F1 and F2 flies could be used to determine the loci of the genes on X-chromosome -- it was important here to record gender in this scoring. However, if no genes are found on the X-chromosome (based on the results of Crosses A and B), then simply scoring F2 flies would be helpful to later determine the map distance between linked genes not on the X-chromosome. This is possible because if the genes are not sex-linked, then ignoring the secondary marker characteristics of the F2 would make them functionally the same as the F2's of cross A and B -- since then they become equivalent to the wild-type flies.
Finally, the Crosses II and III were done to determine where the genes were located in regards to the second and third autosome, with autosomal specific traits. Specifics of these marker types and their phenotypic expression can be found in the MATERIALS AND METHODS. In brief, however, these initial crosses, when scored would help show only if the mutant genes were dominant or recessive. A secondary backcross of the male progeny of these crosses with unknown virgin females was necessary to determine which chromosome the genes were on. Notably absent for all the crosses described here is an emphasis on autosome IV; since this autosome is so small it is not likely that these mutations' loci are there.
The crosses and scoring were done over a series of seven weeks and all flies for all crosses were grown at 24° C. All flies were anesthetized using CO2 and inspected under a dissecting or stereoscopic microscope while on CO2 pads. The average time sedated was minimized to prevent sterility. Flies were handled with small brushes and prodding needles; for specifics on fly handling please see Jeyabalan (2005).
In total five different cultures of flies were used: Oregon-R (Ore-R) type wilds, unknown culture U-5343, and marker stocks labeled M-I, M-II, M-III. Two Ore-R stocks and eight mutant stocks were initially provided. Two new cultures of U-5343 were made during the experiment to maintain the stock for later backcrosses. There was continuous access to all marker stocks. Wild-type flies were phenotypically described as: tan bodied, red eyed, full wing venation with straight wings, and normal straight bristles. U-5343 flies were observed to be black bodied with white eyes and lacked a complete LII and LIV longitudinal veins (failing to reach margin); they were wild-type for all marker genes. M-I flies were wild-type expect for the following traits: crossvienless (cv-X-chromosome @ 13.7) and forked, shortened bristles (f-X-chromosome @ 56.7). M-II flies were wild-type expect for the following traits: short-thin bristles (Bl-autosome II @ 54.8), small 'lobed' eyes (L-autosome II @ 72.0), and with curled wings (Cy-autosome II @ 6.1). M-II was a balanced-lethal culture so all flies showed a Bl L/Cy genotype. M-III flies were wild-type expect for the following traits: small 'smooth' eyes (Gl-autosome III @ 41.4) and short blunt bristles (Sb-autosome III @ 58.2) with the inversion known as LVM present (autosome III lethal balancing inversion), a non-phenotypically expressed trait. Again, M-III was a balanced -- lethal culture so all flies showed a Gl Sb/LVM genotype. All cultures were true breeding. For more details about mark stocks and traits see Jeyabalan (2005)
Concerning the crosses in general, when virgin females were needed all flies were removed from source bottle and, then, 6-8 hours later virgin females were harvested. For all crosses parent flies were removed from bottles 8-10 days after the cross and all flies were scored 14-20 days after the cross. All crosses were done in duplicate unless otherwise indicated. When scoring, body color, eye color, wing venation, sex, and relevant marker traits were all recorded. See appendix (skeletal report) for scoring data table structure.
Cross A: unknown virgin females were crossed with wild-type males, F1 flies were scored. From the F1 generation, flies were collected and placed into a new bottle for the F1xF1 of Cross A. F2 flies were scored.
Cross B: unknown virgin females were crossed with wild-type males, F1 flies were scored. From the F1 generation, flies were collected and placed into a new bottle for the F1xF1 of Cross B. F2 flies were scored.
Marker Cross I: unknown virgin females were crossed with M-I males, F1 flies were scored. From the F1 generation, flies were collected and placed into a new bottle for the F1xF1 of Cross I. F2 flies were scored.
Marker Cross II: unknown virgin females were crossed with M-II type males, F1 flies were scored. From the F1 generation, Bl L/Cy+ male flies were collected and crossed with unknown virgin females -- a male backcross. Cross was not done in duplicate. Additionally, Bl+ L+/Cy male flies were collected and crossed with unknown virgin females -- not done in duplicate. The first cross yielded offspring which were scored. The second cross yielded no offspring, so no flies were scored.
Marker Cross III: unknown virgin females were crossed with M-III type males, F1 flies were scored. From the F1 generation, Gl Sb/LVM+ male flies were collected and crossed with unknown virgin females -- a male backcross. The male backcross progeny were scored.
After all the data was collected, the unneeded flies were euthanized and discarded in a humane fashion.
In general, all but one of the crosses went as expected and there were no major problems with determining the nature of the genes involved in the U-5343 mutant culture. In the analysis below, to find any χ2 calculations please see appendix (calculations); also, please see appendix (skeletal report) for raw data tables.
These two tables are very revealing: first, since these crosses were reciprocal and there is no significant differences between male and female expressed phenotype, it is most likely that all mutations are autosomal in nature. Secondly, since no mutant types are present in any flies, it should be that the mutations are all recessive. These conclusions can only be drawn, however, because it was given that the unknowns were true-breeding homozygous mutants. Further analysis of the F2 generation helps confirm these initial observations.
Qualitatively, in the F2 generation, mutant wing venation and normal wing venation were both observed. Additionally, mutant body color and wild-type body color were observed. However, four eye colors were observed: red, white, orange and brown -- suggesting that more then one mutant gene is affecting eye color.
Observations of the male parent backcross help to reveal the autosome associated with the mutant genes. As aforementioned, the two marker crosses represent a balanced lethal system, where heterozygosity is maintained, even in the face of crossing over. With such marker systems, one can easily determine the autosome upon which an unknown mutation lies. Backcrossing the males (hybrid M-II, or M-III, and unknown flies) with the unknown female culture produces male backcross progeny. If the recessive mutation(s) is linked to the markers, then it will not show-up with the marker phenotype in the male back cross progeny -- since crossing over does not occur in the male Drosophila. Alternatively, if the recessive mutation(s) does show up with the marker type, then it must be independently assorting and, therefore, on a different autosome than the marker.
For the male backcross progeny observed here, compelling results allow for autosomal assignment of all mutant genes. M-II backcross progeny were observed phenotypically as bristle, lobed, and black bodied -- showing that the body color is not on the second autosome, but on the third. Also, neither the wing mutation nor the eye color mutation were present with the markers in the M-II backcross progeny, implying their presence on the second autosome. However, the curly-type backcross did not produce any viable offspring; most likely because balanced lethal systems often create very fragile males, easily sterilized by overexposure to CO2. Nevertheless, the M-III backcross showed glued, stubbled, white-eyed, wing mutant flies, confirming the presence of these three mutant genes (a, b, and tv) on the second autosome and supporting the results of the successful M-II backcross. Additionally, the mutant body color did not show up with the marker phenotypes, also corroborating the assignment of this gene to the third autosome.
In summary then, the mutant genes a, b, and tv are on the second autosome and the mutant gene bb is on the third autosome. Thus, using a three point cross and the combined data of the F2 progeny from crosses A, B, and M-I, one can complete2 the map of autosome two, by determining the mutant positions. However, from these experiments, the map of autosome three cannot be completed; though, a female parent back cross of M-III would allow for the missing mapping data to be scored.
As all other crosses have indicated, no unknown mutations are present on the X-chromosome. This, however, does not mean that the M-I cross was done in vain -- by ignoring the marker phenotypes, the M-I cross effectively becomes the same as the A/B crosses. Thus, by combining all of these crosses (table 7), a robust data set is created where a three point cross can determine the map distances between a, b, and tv. From the table then:
From these map points, we see that the proper gene order is tv-b-a and we can now map the autosome. The mutation tv is was given at 3.8 mu. Therefore, b is 3.8+42.0 = 45.8 mu and a is 3.8+81 = 84.8. The map, with all marker genes included, is represented by image 1:
Through well thought-out cross breeding experiments, the previously unknown genetic components of a true breeding Drosophila m. culture (U-5342) was determined. In all, four new genes were discovered and described, in brief, that control body color, wing venation, and eye color. The gene bb ("black body") is autosomal recessive and located on the third autosome; further tests are needed to establish the exact location. The genes a and b epistatically controlling eye-color, they are linkage with a distance of about 38.6 mu. They express themselves in four ways phenotypically, red (a+_bb), orange (a+_bb), brown (aab+_) and white (aabb). And are mapped at the locations in the figure above. Finally, the gene tv (pre-terminating LII and LIV longitudinal veins) is autosomal recessive and on the second chromosome, also mapped above with a and b.

The ability of a species to compete for limited resources is often central to its ability to survive in a given environment. Different species possess differential competitive abilities, which are often dependent upon environmental conditions. For all organisms, the effects of competition become more pronounced with an increase in density because more organisms are searching for resources in the same areas, depleting the resources to continually lower levels.
One way that plants gain a competitive edge is by forming mutualistic relationships with other organisms, thereby working together to promote mutual survival. Rhizobium bacteria have a symbiotic relationship with the roots of legumes in which they fix atmospheric nitrogen and provide it to the plant in exchange for resources such as carbon (Begon, et al., 2003).
In this experiment we examined how the presence of Rhizobium affected the competitive ability of red clover (Trifolium pretense) which is a legume, when grown with red fescue (Festuca rubra) which is not leguminous. We hypothesized that Rhizobium form a mutualistic relationship with legumes and provide it with nitrogen, and from this we predicted that red clover would compete better against red fescue (a grass) in environments with Rhizobium present.
Our results did not indicate a difference in competitive ability of red fescue in the presence or absence of Rhizobium. This is illustrated by the fact that the confidence intervals in the linear regression graphs are broadly overlapping (Figure 1). The R squared values for the Rhizobium and no Rhizobium treatments of .810 and .778 respectively indicate that the best fit lines in the graph are accurate representations of our data. The p-values of .038 and .048 for the R square data indicate that it is statistically significant, which means there is a significant relationship between target weight and neighbor density and hence that competition is occurring.
Our results did not support our prediction that red clover would compete better in the presence of Rhizobium. One explanation for this is the possibility that we made some incorrect assumptions as part of our experimental model. One important assumption we made was that nitrogen was a limiting resource which both plant species were competing for, which in reality may or may not have been the case. The nitrogen concentration may have been high enough in the soil that the additional nitrogen provided by the Rhizobium did not provide any appreciable advantage to the red clover. If this were the case, then the Rhizobium may have actually hurt the clover's competitive ability by taking its resources without providing necessary nutrients in exchange. If we were able to do the experiment again, it would be helpful to test the nitrogen content of the soil to ensure that it is in fact a limiting resource.
Another important assumption we made was that red clover and red fescue shared the same traits apart from clover being a legume and fescue a grass. However, there is one other difference in that red clover is a dicot while red fescue is a monocot. Physiological differences, particularly in the root system, suggest that dicots are better at absorbing nutrients from the soil than monocots. Although this would imply that clover is still a better competitor, it is possible that there are other confounding factors which gave the fescue a similar competitive effect in the presence and absence of Rhizobium.
A more practical aspect of our experimental design that could be problematic is that we looked at the biomass of the part of the plant above the ground only, by clipping it at ground level and then weighing it. If the effects of competition led one plant species or the other to divert more resources to the roots and away from stems and leaves, our data could be misleading.
One other potential problem exists with our model in that it does not account for the proximity of plants to each other. While it is a logical assumption that with increasing density, proximity of plants increases, it is possible that in low density plots, seeds of competitors by chance happened to fall very close to the target seeds. The closer the plants are physically, the more their resource utilization areas overlap, and the stronger the effects of competition between them.
Aside from the aforementioned problems with the assumptions of our model, the additive design of our experiment seems to be the best way to examine competition between species. An additional experiment we could have performed is a replacement series in which the proportion of the two species is varied while keeping the total plant density the same. The problem with this approach is that it is impossible to distinguish between intra-and interspecific competition (Park et al., 2003). Since for this experiment we are looking specifically at the interspecific competitive effects, the additive design is the better approach.
Examining the competitive effects and responses of various plant species to interactions with other species has particular relevance to ecologists or conservation biologists trying to manipulate species composition. Over the long term, it would seem that competitive response is more important to a plant's ability to persist at a site. Unless the plant is the top competitor in an ecosystem, it is likely that with time other species which are good competitors will begin to grow at the same site and deplete the resource base to low levels. In order to persist, the plant will have to be tolerant of low resource levels; otherwise it will be outcompeted by plant species which are better able to absorb resources from the environment.
Although some plants that have a strong competitive effect also have a strong competitive response, the two do not necessarily go together. It is possible that a plant which has a strong competitive effect is good at hoarding resources at a particular site and simply survives by preventing other species from establishing there.
This experimental model also has relevance to the Lotka-Volterra model for competition. In order to test whether stable coexistence can occur (the effects of intraspecific competition are greater than interspecific), we would have to do an additional experiment in which the target and neighbor species were switched, because the current set-up only determines the effect of fescue on clover and not vice-versa. With data from both density experiments there are equations which make it possible to sort out the effects of intra-vs. interspecific competition (Park et al., 2003).
Establishing the effects of plant species interactions has a lot of implications for farming (weed-crop competition), plant conservation and the management of invasive species. By understanding how different environmental conditions affect these interactions, ecologists will be better able to use this knowledge to their advantage in creating environments which allow for a particular target species to have the greatest competitive advantage.

Pollution of aquatic environments by petroleum products is an issue of concern to many ecologists and environmentalists. While it receives a lot of attention after major commercial oil spills, this is not in fact the primary source of oil pollution. According to a report by the National Academies' National Research council, 29 million gallons of petroleum products enter North American waters annually from anthropogenic sources, 85% of which is from land runoff, oil-contaminated rivers, airplanes and small watercraft. All this is in addition to the 47 million gallons that naturally seep into waters through the ocean floor (Coleman, et al., 2003).
Petroleum products can have several negative consequences for aquatic ecosystems. The major constituents of petroleum products are complex hydrocarbons, comprising 80-90% of unused motor oil (Irwin, et al., 1997). Of all these hydrocarbon groups, polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are thought have the most toxic effects, as they attach easily to sediment surfaces and are relatively resistant to degradation (Vo, et al., 2004). Oil slicks formed at the surface can potentially limit oxygen exchange at the water-air boundary, decreasing the levels of dissolved oxygen in the water. Oil at the surface also has the potential to coat the gills of aquatic organisms, adversely affecting respiration (Bhattacharyya, et al., 2003).
Not many studies have been done to investigate the effects of oil pollution on freshwater systems, as most large-scale oil spills occur in marine environments. However, studies on the effects of the more general category of freshwater pollutants, which include oils/grease, but also heavy metals and other toxic pollutants, have been done. In fact, aquatic insects are often used as an indicator of water quality, a concept known as biomonitoring. Benthic invertebrates are the most frequently used organisms in biomonitoring, as they are a diverse group of organisms which exhibit varying degrees of tolerance to environmental conditions (Merritt and Cummings, 1996). Insects of the order Odonata, which includes damselflies and dragonflies, are known to be moderately sensitive to environmental pollutants, and their absence from a particular habitat is frequently indicative of poor water quality. In an experiment investigating the effects of urban runoff on stream water quality, benthic organisms were surveyed upstream and downstream of an urban development. The prevalence of dragonflies was found to be significantly higher at upstream sites (22%) than at downstream sites (4%). It was concluded that this was a result of pollution and eutrophication decreasing the levels of dissolved oxygen in the stream sites downstream of the development (DeBarruel and West, 2003).
Odonates are particularly sensitive to dissolved oxygen levels. According to Merritt and Cummings (1996) "a major challenge for any aquatic insect is to obtain sufficient quantities of oxygen for its metabolic needs" (36). For dragonflies and damselflies this is particularly true due to their closed tracheal systems; rather than obtaining oxygen through direct contact with air, their tracheal gills uptake oxygen dissolved in the water (Merritt and Cummings, 1996). Therefore any circumstance which decreases dissolved oxygen levels has negative repercussions for dragonfly and damselfly respiration.
For this experiment, I set up a laboratory system to investigate the effects of different concentrations of motor oil on dragonfly nymphs and their predatory interactions with damselfly nymphs. The dependence of dragonflies and damselflies on relatively high levels of dissolved oxygen, and oil's effects on dissolved oxygen concentration led me to hypothesize that adding motor oil to simulated pond environments would affect activity levels in dragonflies. I predicted that an increase in concentration of motor oil would lead to lower activity levels in dragonflies.
The activity levels of both dragonflies and damselflies have implications for predation. Both dragonflies and damselflies are predatory insects, but presumably due to size advantage, dragonflies prey on damselflies and not vice-versa. Dragonflies are generally ambush predators, waiting for prey to approach before attacking, but will occasionally switch to a more active foraging strategy if food availability is low (Gullan and Cranston, 2005). They rely primarily on tactile cues in searching for prey but also take advantage of visual cues (Resh and Rosenberg, 1984).
As a corollary to my first hypothesis, I hypothesized that the addition of oil to the environments would have an effect on predation rates. A decrease in activity of damselflies (prey) would result in fewer visual cues for dragonflies and a decrease in activity level of dragonflies would lead to less active foraging behavior. Therefore, I predicted a negative correlation between oil concentration and number of prey eaten.
I set up five clear plastic containers and filled each with 2 liters of pond water in an attempt to most effectively simulate a natural freshwater habitat. The first container was a control with no oil added, and the four successive containers were contaminated with increasing concentrations of unused motor oil (.1%, .5%, 1% and 2%). I collected dragonfly and damselfly nymphs from Willow Pond at Matthaei Botanical Gardens, and added one dragonfly predator to each container along with multiple damselfly prey. I performed two replicates of the experiment; two damselflies were placed with each dragonfly in the first replicate and six damselflies in the second. [Note: I misidentified several of the prey items I added to the containers in the 2nd replicate, meaning that some containers contained a mixture of mayflies and damselflies. However, I don't believe this should have an effect on the experiment as both are preyed upon by dragonfly nymphs].
After placing the insects in the containers, I collected data on their activity level by tracking their movement at ten minute intervals. Every ten minutes I marked the approximate location of the dragonfly and then noted whether it moved from that spot in the following time interval. I collected activity data a second time after the insects had been exposed to the oil for five days. During each collection I recorded data for five time intervals.
In order to determine the predation rate, I counted the number of surviving damselflies after five days and then determined the number of prey eaten. I divided this by the initial number of prey items in order to determine the percentage of prey eaten. I used percentage of prey eaten rather than number of prey eaten to standardize the measurements for the two replicates, since they had different initial numbers of prey. Because I wanted to determine how a range of concentrations affected percentage of prey eaten, I performed a linear regression on the data.
The graph of the linear regression examining the relationship between oil concentration and dragonfly activity showed a very weak negative correlation between the two variables (Figure 2). The very low R squared value (.034) reveals that the best fit line is not an accurate reflection of the data at all. Furthermore, the p-value is well over .05 (.612) meaning that the slope is not significantly different from zero.
The graph of the linear regression relating percentage of prey eaten to oil concentration showed an overall negative correlation (slope =-.378) (Figure 1). The standard error measurement for the slope is relatively high as there are many data points which are quite far from the line. The R squared value of .527 indicates that the best fit line is a satisfactory representation of the data but is not exceptionally accurate. The low p-value (.017) denotes a significant relationship between the two variables.
The results do not support my first prediction of a negative correlation between oil concentration and dragonfly activity. The high p-value suggests that the activity data are a result of random chance and hence no significant relationship exists between the two variables. There are several possible explanations for this. First of all, more data would be necessary to make any solid conclusions about the activity level of dragonfly nymphs. With such a small sample size (four data points in two replicates) results are unlikely to show concrete trends, as any outliers have a significant effect. Secondly, dragonfly nymphs may not be particularly active organisms in general, as they are "sit and wait" predators and do not resort to active foraging unless it becomes necessary for survival (Gullan and Cranston, 2005). Lastly, activity measurements were taken during the day, while dragonflies tend to be more active at night as an avoidance mechanism from predation by fish and other aquatic organisms (Merritt and Cummins, 1996). Taking more activity data over a longer period of time, with some collections being done at night would likely provide a clearer picture of the relationship between oil pollution and activity levels.
It would have been helpful to measure the dissolved oxygen levels in the different environments, as the whole notion of the decreased activity levels was predicated on the notion that surface oil inhibits diffusion of oxygen through the water. Some studies suggest that it takes several months of exposure to oil before a measurable difference in oxygen concentration is detectable. Harrel (1985) studied the effects of an oil spill in a Texas stream, comparing the water quality of the contaminated stream with that of a nearby control stream. Four days after the initial oil spill, oil was visible on the water surface and there was a strong smell of hydrocarbons, but measurements of water quality did not differ much between the two streams. Not until six months later were decreases in dissolved oxygen concentration apparent (Harrel, 1985). If this were the case in our system, then no difference in activity levels would be expected after only five days.
Though prediction 1 was not supported, prediction 2, regarding the relationship between oil concentration and predation rate, was supported. The regression line showed a statistically significant negative correlation between the two variables. The reasons for these results are not entirely clear, however, nor are the results free of statistical flaws. One of the biggest statistical problems I encountered was due to the fact that I had different numbers of initial prey items in the two replications. While I tried to standardize the predation measurements by examining the percentage of prey eaten as opposed to the number of prey eaten, this did not completely solve the problem, because there was not a continuous range of possible values for the percentage. For the first replicate, because there were only two prey, there were only three incremental possibilities for predation percentage, 0%, 50% and 100% while in the 2nd replicate there was a broader yet still incremental range (0, 1/6, 1/3, ½, etc). Statistically it would have been far better to have six initial prey items in both replicates.
While my initial hypothesis that decreased oxygen levels would lead to less active foraging behavior from the dragonflies and fewer movements (i.e. visual cues) by the damselfly may still hold, it is called into question by the failure of prediction 1. An alternative possibility is that the thick, opaque film formed on the top of the water blocked a large portion of the incoming light and made it more difficult for the dragonflies to clearly see prey. It is also possible that ingestion of toxic water-soluble components of oil led to changes in the predator's ability to search for or attack prey.
There is a compelling possibility that the number of prey eaten was more strongly correlated to predator size than to concentration of oil. I did not take quantitative data on predator size, but based on my observations, those predators that ate the largest percentage of prey also tended to be the largest of the predator group. This makes logical sense as large predators have higher energy needs and need to consume more prey in order to satisfy those needs. The size of predators and prey was not a factor that was controlled for and may have had a significant impact on the results.
A second factor which was not controlled for but could have affected the results was the presence of secondary food sources. It was assumed that in this environment dragonfly nymphs would prey exclusively upon damselfly nymphs; however, dragonflies are generalists and will consume anything small enough for them to handle. Since pond water was used in the experiment, small prey items such as Daphnia and midges were present in unknown quantities, because their small size made them impossible to filter out. Smaller dragonflies may have preferred to go after these smaller prey items in lieu of damselflies, violating the underlying assumption of the experiment.
Future versions of this experiment could be improved by using larger sample sizes and taking more measurements over a longer time period. It would be interesting to include the size of the predator as one experimental factor by measuring either the weight or length of the dragonflies, and examine the interactions between size and oil concentration, and how that effects predation rate, determining which factor seems to have the greatest effect. Also, future experimenters would ideally find a way to ensure that damselflies were the only food resource available to dragonflies.
The results of this experiment have implications for those trying to maintain a species balance within aquatic ecosystems. If oil concentration does directly affect predation (in addition to other factors like size) it is important to put forth greater efforts to reduce oil pollution coming into ponds and rivers from everyday sources such as road run-off. Dragonfly and damselfly nymphs both play key roles in aquatic food webs both as predators and as prey. By changing predatory behavior and species composition at one trophic level, oil pollution has the potential to radiate throughout the food web, causing indirect effects up to the human level.

The development of a testable hypothesis is an important part of the scientific method and is a key characteristic of good science. Hypotheses help to define the focus of research and create experiments that can provide answers to meaningful questions. Without well-defined hypotheses researchers run the risk of making erroneous conclusions from data that was not collected in an experiment appropriately designed to test for those conclusions.
In this study I examined the difference in frequency of hypothesis testing between two journals. I hypothesized that the best quality journals would be most selective in accepting submissions and therefore would be most likely to publish articles which strongly adhere to the scientific method. I predicted that the highest quality journals would have more articles with a clearly defined hypothesis than lower quality journals.
As a quantitative measure of journal quality I used the journal impact factor which is defined by ISI as, "a measure of the frequency with which the 'average article' in a journal has been cited in a particular year or period" (Thomson Scientific website). The rating is calculated by dividing the number of times articles from the previous two years in the journal were cited in the current year by the total number of articles published in the previous two years. The use of the journal impact factor as an indicator of journal quality is controversial in the scientific community, as a number of concerns have been raised about it; however, for the purposes of this study it provides the best objective and quantifiable measure of quality.
In order to test my prediction that articles from higher-impact journals would have clearer a priori hypotheses, I examined five articles from each of two different journals. For the high-impact journal I selected Ecology, which is in the top ten of ecology journals with an impact factor of 3.7. As a comparatively lower-impact journal I selected Plant Ecology, with an impact factor of 1.28. Articles were selected based on time of publication (2000-2005 only) and subject matter (invasive plant species).
In evaluating each article based on the clarity of the hypothesis, I assigned each article a rating from 1 to 3. A rating of three is indicative of an indisputably clear hypothesis stated in the article abstract or introduction. A two signifies that some background theory and research questions were addressed, but no specific hypotheses were provided. A rating of one designates those articles that did not have any indication of a hypothesis being tested.
Table 1 shows the ratings I assigned to each article as a quantification of the clarity of the hypothesis being tested in the experiment. Articles are numbered according to the order that they are presented in the literature cited section at the end. All five articles in the journal Ecology received the highest rating, indicative of clear hypotheses unambiguously stated in the article's introduction. Hypothesis testing in Plant Ecology varied from 1-3.
The data appear to support the hypothesis and prediction, as all articles from the high-impact journal had clearly stated hypotheses compared with only two from the lower-impact journal. Admittedly, this is not a conclusive finding as the sample size used was quite small and the ranking system was not completely objective or scientific.
For the articles given a rating of 3, hypotheses were explicitly stated, generally in the form "we hypothesized that..." or the typical "if...then" format. All of these articles addressed their hypothesis in the discussion, stating whether it was supported or contradicted. In all cases where the results were inconsistent with the hypothesis, alternatives hypotheses were proposed along with ideas for future investigation into the a posteriori hypothesis.
The article that received a two (article 7) listed a series of questions the study was designed to address but did not suggest an answer to any of these questions a priori. In the discussion at the end, the authors addressed each question individually and proposed several a posteriori hypotheses based on the data they collected. Interestingly, this illustrated some of the problems associated with this style of experimentation. The authors acknowledged that they were unable to provide an answer to their first question because their experimental design was unsuitable for doing so. Similarly, few concrete answers were found for the subsequent questions as the authors were primarily only able to provide speculation based on data and observations. Had they designed experiments to test specific a priori hypotheses, perhaps they would have been able to make more definitive conclusions.
The two articles that received a rating of one broadly defined the aims of their experiment but did not narrow the scope enough by providing a specific hypothesis. The introductions of article 10 and article 8 explained what they hoped to determine as a result of the experiment but did not provide any predictions or indicate any expected results. Both papers were more exploratory in nature but both achieved results which seemed to satisfy the objective of their study.
All papers seemed to be logical and well-organized, partly due to the fact that all scientific papers follow a similar format: abstract followed by introduction, materials and methods, and so on. This essentially forces the author(s) to structure the paper in a way that is logical for the reader. The only way in which the presentation of papers might be improved is by making a more explicit connection between a hypothesis and the experiment designed to test that hypothesis. When papers have multiple hypotheses in the introduction and multiple tests described in the methods section, it would be helpful to know which test was done specifically to address a particular hypothesis.
Hypothesis testing has always been presented as a cornerstone of science so it is surprising that a significant number of science articles are being published without clear hypotheses. The results of this study suggests that there is a possible positive correlation between a journal's impact factor and hypothesis testing within its articles, though more study needs to be done. In order to test this hypothesis more thoroughly it would be important to use larger sample sizes and select articles from additional publications with both high and low impact factors.

Drosophila melanogaster is an ideal genetic model organism in several respects. Because of its small size it is easily manipulated, its short life cycle allows for genetic analysis over several generations in a short period of time, its few chromosomes simplify genetic analysis, and previous researchers have already identified and mapped many mutations. The overall purpose for this experiment was to map unknown heritable mutations in Drosophila to their chromosomal locations. The main hypothesis was that the three mutant traits, dark body color, white eye, and short longitudinal veins, were being inherited in a normal autosomal recessive pattern. Specifically, our aims were to cross unknown Drosophila stock to Oregon-R and to Marker flies, with previously mapped chromosomal mutations, to determine for each mutant trait the method of inheritance and the chromosomal location. Specific hypotheses are: that genes for body color are segregating normally, genes for wing venation are segregating normally, body color and wing venation genes are independently assorting, two genes determine eye color, the two eye color genes are independently assorting, and the eye color genes are linked to the body color gene.
F1 were wild type for all three mutant traits, with no difference between male and female phenotype.
F2 progeny had four distinct eye colors, with red the most frequent, but white, orange, and brown appearing with similar frequencies. Light body occurred more frequently than dark body. 
F1 were wild type for all three mutant traits, with no difference between male and female phenotype.
F2 progeny had four distinct eye colors, with red the most frequent, but white, orange, and brown appearing with similar frequencies. Light body occurred more frequently than dark body.
More wild type phenotypes appear for both body color and wing venation.
Red eye color is the most frequent, and white, orange, and brown appear with similar frequencies.
Dark body color shows up with Bristle Lobed; mutant wing venation never shows up with Bristle Lobed.
With one exception, dark body color does not show up with Glued Stubble. Mutant wing venation does show up with Glued Stubble.
Red eye color appears most frequently, and white, orange, and brown appear with similar frequencies. Light body color is more frequent than dark body color. Wild type wing venation is more frequent than mutant wing venation.
Crosses A and B were set up as reciprocal crosses in order to determine whether the unknown mutations were autosomal or sex-linked and dominant or recessive. From the Cross A-F1 results (Table 1), we conclude that the pattern of inheritance for all three mutations is recessive, because they do not appear in the F1 offspring, and autosomal, because the F1 males appear wild type. If any of the mutations had been sex-linked, F1 males would have received a mutant gene from the P female and a Y chromosome from the P male and would have presented a mutant phenotype. From the Cross B-F1 results (Table 3), we also conclude that the pattern of inheritance for all three mutations is recessive because they do not appear in the F1 offspring, but we cannot determine whether the mutations are autosomal. If all the mutations were autosomal, F1 progeny would have one mutant and one wild type copy of each gene and a wild type phenotype. If any of the mutations were sex-linked, they still would not show up in the F1 progeny because the females would have one X chromosome with a wild type copy of the genes, giving it a wild type phenotype, and the males would only have a wild type copy of the mutant genes on their X chromosome from the P female. However, since the reciprocal crosses produced the same results, we can conclude that the mutations are autosomal.
If genes for body color are segregating normally as hypothesized, we expect a F2 ratio of wild type body color to mutant body color of 3:1. Based on the combined F2 results of A and B, we observed a ratio of 3.4:1 (Table 10). The X2 value for these results is 1.39, which corresponds to a p value greater than 0.05, and we can deduce that the mutant body color gene is segregating normally. A 3:1 phenotypic ratio corresponds to an autosomal recessive trait so we conclude that the body color gene is autosomal recessive. With the null hypothesis that genes for wing venation are segregating normally, we expect a F2 ratio of wild type wing venation to mutant wing venation of 3:1. From the combined F2 results of A and B (Table 11), we observed a ratio of 3.5:1. The X2 value for these results is 2.25, which corresponds to a p value greater than 0.05, and by the same reasoning as above, we deduce that the wing venation gene is autosomal recessive. We next hypothesized that body color gene and wing venation gene were assorting independently. With this hypothesis we expect a ratio for wild type body color and wild type wing venation: mutant body color and wild type wing venation: wild type body color and mutant wing venation: mutant body color and mutant wing venation of 11.9:3.5:3.4:1 (Table 12). We observed a ratio of 13.2:4.0:3.9:1.0; the X2 value for this set of data is 0.24, corresponding to a p value greater than 0.05, and we can deduce with that body color and wing venation are assorting independently.
We observed red, brown, orange, and white eyes in a ratio close to 6:1:1:1 in the F2 progeny (Table 6). Based on this we propose that two genes (orange eyes, a, and brown eyes, b) are involved in the expression of eye color, because with the simplifying assumption that each mutant gene has two alleles, at least two genes are needed to produce four phenotypes. Our hypothesis of interaction is a parallel pathway where at least one wild type copy of each gene is needed to produce the wild type red eye (Fig. 1). Our null hypothesis for their association is that they are independently assorting. This gives a X2 value of 61, which corresponds to a p value less than 0.05 and a strong rejection of the hypothesis. Therefore the two genes for eye color are linked. F1 progeny were all a+b+/ab (ab received from the unknown parent and a+b+ received from the wild type parent). Because crossing-over during meiosis only occurs in female gametes, all male gametes were either ab or a+b+, and recombinant female gametes were a+b or ab+, producing the following recombinant genotypes and phenotypes: a+b/ab (brown), a+b+/ a+b+ (red), ab+/ab (orange), and ab+/a+b+ (red). Based on the frequency of these recombinant genotypes within the F2 progeny, the two eye color genes are located 45.4 map units apart.
Overall the data from F1 and F2 of Crosses A and B did not present any problems and from it we concluded that the three mutant traits have a high probability of being autosomal, body color and wing venation have a high probability of assorting independently, and it is highly probable that two linked genes control eye color.
Crosses II and III were set up with unknown flies crossed with Marker II and Marker III stocks respectively. Marker II and Marker III stocks serve as chromosomal markers because they carry dominant homozygous lethal mutations. Marker II has mutant alleles of the Bristle and Lobed genes and a wild type allele of the Curly gene on one copy of chromosome II and wild type alleles of the Bristle and Lobed genes and a mutant allele of the Curly gene on the other copy. Because these three mutations are dominant, these flies should present short bristles, curly wings, and small lobed eyes but the bristle phenotype does not show up in the Marker II flies we have. Marker III has mutant alleles of the Glued and Stubble genes and a wild type allele of the chromosomal inversion LVM on one copy of chromosome III and wild type alleles of the Glued and Stubble genes and a mutant allele of the chromosomal inversion LVM on the other copy. As these three mutations are dominant, Marker III flies have small, smooth eyes and short blunt stubbles (LVM has no mutant phenotype). Both marker stocks are true-breeding because any progeny that do not have the same genotype as the parents lethally receive two copies of at least one mutation (Fig. 2).
In order to map body color and wing venation genes to chromosomes, we set up F1 male backcrosses for Crosses II and III. In a F1 male backcross, F1 males showing a marker phenotype are crossed to unknown females. In the backcross progeny, if an unknown mutant trait shows up with a marker, then the mutant trait and marker are on different chromosomes; if they do not show up together, they are on the same chromosome. For Cross II-F1 male backcross progeny, dark mutant body color shows up with both Bristle Lobed and Curly markers, indicating that the body color gene is not on chromosome II with them (Table 7). Mutant wing venation never shows up with Bristle Lobed or Curly, indicating the wing venation gene is on the chromosome II with those markers. For Cross III F1 male backcross progeny, dark mutant body color does not show up with Glued Stubble markers, indicating the body color gene is also on chromosome III (Table 8). Mutant wing venation does show up with the Glued Stubble markers, indicating that the wing venation gene is not on chromosome III. There is one exception of a dark bodied, Glued Stubble fly, but as it is only one fly, this is probably due to human scoring error or the presence of a random fly from the lab during scoring.
Overall the Cross II and III F1 and male F1 backcross data strongly support the conclusion that body color gene is on the chromosome III and wing venation gene is on chromosome II.
We set up Cross I between unknown virgin females and crossveinless forked Marker I males and carried the cross through the F2 generation. In the F1 generation we expected to see all phenotypically wild type females and all crossveinless forked males (Fig. 3). However, we saw wild type males instead of crossveinless forked males and Glued Stubble males and females. Possibly some Marker III males were among the parents, which would account for the presence of Glued Stubble. Since every F1 progeny should have received a mutant gene from the unknown parental female for crossveinless and for forked, all males should show both traits. We do not believe the absence of crossveinless forked males is from scoring error, as we checked many flies repeatedly. An alternate explanation is that the unknown females were not virgin when introduced and produced phenotypically wild type progeny, or that the parental females were not from unknown stock.
As we determined from Crosses A and B, the eye color genes are autosomal. By the combined F2 data from Crosses A, B, and I (Table 9), if we hypothesize that the two eye color genes are independently assorting with each other, we get a X2 value of 98, which corresponds to a p value less than 0.05. So, we must reject the hypothesis and conclude that the two eye color genes are linked. The F1 progeny for all three crosses are all a+b+/ab (ab received from the unknown parent and a+b+ received from the wild type parent). Because crossing-over during meiosis only occurs in female gametes, all male gametes were either ab or a+b+, and recombinant female gametes were a+b or ab+, producing the following recombinant genotypes and phenotypes: a+b/ab (brown), a+b+/ a+b+ (red), ab+/ab (orange), and ab+/a+b+ (red). Based on the frequency of these recombinant genotypes within the combined F2 progeny, the two eye color genes are located 44.2 map units apart.
In Table 9, mutant eye color and mutant body color appear together less frequently than mutant eye color and mutant wing venation (54 versus 126). In our skeletal report we interpreted this to mean that the wing venation gene and eye color genes were more independent than the body color gene and the eye color genes, and we assigned eye color genes to the chromosome body color is on, chromosome III. We used the body color and eye color data in Table 13 to calculate map distances of 65.9 map units between d (dark body color gene) and a, 67.3 map units between d and b, and 44.2 map units between a and b. This produced the final results seen in Table 15 (p. 15 of Skeletal Report) and Fig. 4 (p. 15 of Skeletal Report). The map in Fig. 4 for chromosome III does not make sense (we have the distance between d and b calculated directly as 67.3 map units, and indirectly by using the distances between d and a and a and b as 110.1 map units) because the eye color genes should really be on chromosome II (as clarified by Jessica Lehoczky). For this report we realized that we misinterpreted our data for the skeletal report. Since in the P generation, mutant eye color, body color, and wing venation all appear together, then linked genes will continue to appear together and unlinked genes will tend to appear separately. Since mutant eye color and mutant wing venation appear together more frequently than mutant eye color and mutant body color, eye color genes are linked to the wing venation gene on chromosome II. With this assignation in Table 14 we calculated map distances of 42.2 map units between sv (short longitudinal vein) and a, 86.4 map units between sv and b, and 44.2 map units between a and b. Table 16 and Fig. 5 show the final determined genetic map for our unknown Drosophila. Although the calculated map distances for sv, b, and a with respect to each other on chromosome II differ from the given values of sv (II:3.8), a (II:57.0), and b (II:104.5) (as clarified by Jessica Lehoczky), they are more logical than the distances found when body color and eye color genes are linked. The difference between our experimentally determined map distances and the actual numbers could be due to scoring error, crossing error, or an insufficiently sized pool.
Looking at Table 16, we can see that in U-4033 Drosophila the unknown genes orange (a), brown (b), dark body (d), and short veins (sv) are all autosomal recessive, with genes a, b, and sv on chromosome II and gene d on chromosome III. The linked genes a, b, and sv are mapped on chromosome II with respect to each other as shown in Fig 5. To help further clarify our data,

Bacteria are unicellular, haploid organisms that are suited for experiments because they reproduce rapidly by binary fission, produce genetically identical progeny, and are genetically simple. Normal bacteria can grow on minimal media, media containing only water, a carbon source, and inorganic salts, but some mutant auxotrophic bacteria have specific nutritional requirements. These requirements can be used to select for or against specific strains. Some bacteria can transfer a copy of accessory DNA to another by conjugation. During conjugation, cells containing a sex factor, F+, unidirectionally transfer a copy of this sex factor to cells lacking the sex factor, F-, through a conjugation canal. Because the conjugation canal is easily broken, the entire F factor rarely transfers, and so genes closer to the origin of the F factor (the first point to enter the F-cells) will appear with greater frequency among the resulting progeny. Once the F factor has been transferred the new genes will be expressed if they are dominant, and recombination can occur between the new genes and the DNA of the recipient cell. This phenomenon can be used to map bacterial genes. The frequency with which a particular gene appears in exconjugant progeny depends on its distance from the origin, and the number of recombinant progeny can be used to determine relative map distance between genes. In this experiment we conjugated F+ and F-cells with different genotypes and plated the resulting exconjugants onto different selective media plates. Our purpose was to determine the order of the genes involved with the selected traits relative to the point of origin, and to determine relative map distances between genes if possible.
From the media 1 replica plates, we counted a total of 144 colonies, with the most on media 1, followed by media 5, media 2, media 3, and media 4 (with zero colonies). From the media 2 replica plates, we counted a total of 137 colonies, with the most on media 2, followed by media 5, media 3, media 1, and media 4 (with zero colonies). The tabulated results are in Tables 1 and 2.
Plate 1 lacked threonine-leucine and selected for TL+, plate 2 lacked proline and selected for pro+, plate 3 lacked glucose and contained lactose and selected for lac+, plate 4 lacked glucose and contained galactose and selected for gal+, and plate lacked methionine and selected for met+. Plate 3 selected for lac+ and plate 4 selected for gal+ because each of those plates selected for bacteria that could utilize lactose and galactose as the sole carbon source, respectively. Among the media 1 replica plates, colonies 1, 2, 4, 10, 20, 23, and 36 did not grow on the media 1 plate, and therefore could not be taken into account for any of the other plates since we could not tell if these colonies on other plates did not grow because of the specific media they were on or because they were plated improperly (Table 3). Among the media 2 replica plates, colonies 1, 6, 34, and 35 did not grow on the media 2 plate, and therefore could not be taken into account for the other plates (Table 4). With these adjustments, the total number of colonies on media 2 replicate plates was 134 and the total number of colonies on media 1 replicate plates was 130. More colonies grew overall on media 2 replica plates than media 1 replica plates, indicating that more colonies received the pro+ gene to survive on the pro-media than received the TL+ gene to survive on the TL-media, and that the pro gene must then come before the TL gene on the F factor. To determine the order of the other genes with respect to each of these markers, for each set we ranked the plates in order of most colonies grown due to received DNA. For plates 1, 2, 3, and 4, this was the number of colonies grown, but for plate 5 this was actually the number of colonies that did not grow since the original F-bacteria were met+ (Tables 3 and 4). So, F-bacteria grew on plate 5, but exconjugant bacteria that received the met-gene did not. For the media 1 replica plates, the colonies grew best on media 1, followed by media 2, media 3, media 5, and media 4. Based on these results, the gene map is: TL, pro, lac, met, and gal (Fig. 1). For the media 2 replica plates, the colonies grew best on media 2, followed by media 3, media 1, media 5, and media 4. Based on these results, the gene map is: pro, lac, TL, met, and gal (Fig. 2). The map based on media 2 plates is better because we know from above that the pro gene is closer to the origin than the TL gene. Since the two maps are inconsistent, we have to modify map 2 to take into account map 1. Based on the example in lecture notes, the modified map is lac, pro, TL, met, and gal (Fig. 3). On this map, the pro and lac genes are closer to the origin than the TL gene, so we can use the TL+ data to determine the distances between pro-TL and TL-lac (but not with gal or met since you can only determine map distances between markers and genes that enter the F-cell before them). Based on the TL+ data, pro and TL are 37.2 map units apart and lac and TL are 60.5 map units apart. From this we infer that lac and pro are 23.3 map units apart. However, looking at colonies selected for lac+ out of the pro+ colonies, the calculated map distance is 23.9 map units. Since calculating small distances is more accurate, we conclude that the map distance between lac and TL is 61.1 map units (Fig. 3). Once again, we cannot calculate any distances involving met or gal since they are farther from the origin than both of the markers we selected for. The slight discrepancy in the results could be due to scoring error, plating error, or other random error we have no control over (such as bacteria that does not grow as well as it should or bacteria that spontaneously mutate to grow when it should not). To compensate for the scoring error, we could dilute our bacteria by another factor of 10, but this would probably make the resulting data pool too small. A better alternative would be to repeat the experiment several times and then calculate the genetic distances using a large pool of data.
We studied conjugation in bacteria and the gradient of transmission method to map five genes on an F factor. We determined that with respect to the point of origin, the genes are in the order: lac, pro, TL, met, and gal, and that the relative map distance between lac and pro is 23.9 map units, between lac and TL is 61.1 map units, and between pro and TL is 37.2 map units.

Lactococcal strains have several important industrial applications. In particular the species Lactococcus lactis has very simple and well characterized biochemical pathways and is added to milk to start the cheese making process. Starter cultures ferment sugars to produce lactic acid which serves to acidify milk and give cheese its flavor and texture (McAuliffe 2001). Lactococcal enzymes that utilize lactose as an energy source (confer Lac+ phenotype) are plasmid encoded as are several other essential enzymes. Bacteriophage resistance, protease and peptidase production, bacteriocin production and resistance are also encoded by genes that are present on native lactococcal plasmids (Cotter 2003). Serine proteases (confer Prt+ phenotype) degrade casein and thus provide the cells with the amino acids they need to grow. Food spoilage caused by pathogenic bacteria is prevented by the bacteriocin nisin that is encoded on several plasmids native to Lactococcus lactis (Takala 2002). The cells must also be resistant to nisin if they produce it (NisR phenotype). Nisin production and resistance, preptidase production, and lactose utilization all give lactococcus advantages in certain environments and are transferred through conjugation from donor to recipient cells by way of plasmids. Conjugation is dependent on transfer (tra) genes and certain self-transmisible plasmids can mobilize other non-transmissible plasmids. Insertion sequences (IS) are present on several lactococcal plasmids and cause recombination events to occur. During conjugation or mobilization, plasmids can recombine so as to produce new plasmids of different sizes and with different genetic makeups. The aim of this investigation was to analyze phenotypic transfer in transconjugants of Lactococcus lactis ssp lactis by selection of individual markers conferred from donor plasmids.
were combined and placed onto a nutrient agar plate to allow for conjugation to occur. The donor strain contained several different sized plasmids. The phenotypes associates with these various sized plasmids are as follows:
The 60kb plasmid encodes tra genes and also has insertion sequences so it is therefore self-transmisible and the IS's allow for recombination events to take place. After conjugation, cells were spread onto three different selective media plates in three replicates. The selection plates used were M17L + Sm, FSDA + Sm, and M17G + Sm + Nis; see Table 1 for an explanation of the phenotypes these selection plates are used to identify. Donor and recipient cells were also separately spread on these selective plates as controls. The number of colonies on each plate was recorded. Ten transconjugants from each of the three selective media plates were selected and streaked for single colonies on their respective medias. These single colonies were then pick and patched onto each of the three selective media plates in order to identify the growth response for the particular transconjugant. The phenotype of the transconjugants was recorded in terms of lactose utilization, nisin resistance, and proteinase production. Within the class each of the different possible phenotypic combinations were chosen and inoculated into M17G broth. The plasmids of these transconjugants were extracted and run on an agarose gel in order to visualize the plasmids present in the transconjugant. See the detailed procedure in the Micro3021 Microbial Genetics Course Kit (Cavicchioli 2005, p. 52-55).
After the conjugation mix was plated onto the selective media plates the number of transconjugants was recorded, see Table 2. These transconjugant counts show the relative transfer frequency of various phenotypes. The most transconjugants, ~900 colonies, were found on the M17G + Sm + Nis plates followed next by the FSDA + Sm plates with ~500 colonies and the M17L + Sm plates had 15 transconjugants.
After single colonies were pick and patched onto the selective media plates many different phenotypic combinations were observed. The results in Table 3 show the class frequency of each phenotype as a percentage. There was a higher frequency of the NisR phenotype than any other phenotype.
The agarose gel phenotypic profile of our class showed that our results were not adequate to complete the report and so plasmid extraction data (Figure 1) and a table of the frequency of transconjugant plasmid profiles for given phenotypes collected throughout the years of this investigation (Figure 2) from Jeff Welch were used. In Figure 1, lanes two and three are the control donor and recipient strains. All of the plasmids (60, 56, 40, 24, and 3.7kb in size) can be visualized in the donor and there are no plasmids in the recipient. The lanes four through twenty-four show the size of plasmids that are present in cells that exhibit certain phenotypes.
Part of the initial transconjugant counts, Table 2, and transfer frequency data, Table 3, was expected. First, the most growth, ~9000 transconjugants/ml, was observed in the M17G + Nisin + Sm plates and the least growth, ~150 transconjugants/ml, was observed on the M17L + Sm plates. We would expect more nisin resistant colonies (growth on M17G + Nisin + Sm plates) than Lac+ colonies (growth on M17L + Sm plates) because nisin resistance is encoded on the 60kb plasmid that is self-transmissible and does not depend on any other plasmid to mobilize its transfer and therefore transfers at a greater frequency. Another reason there are more nisin resistant transconjugants than Lac+ is also because several of the plasmids in the donor strain encoded nisin resistence, both the 56kb and the 60kb plasmids, while only the 40kb plasmid conferred the Lac+ phenotype. There is an over-representation of Prt+ transconjugants. The number of colonies per milliliter would be expected to be similar to the Lac+ since both phenotypes are encoded on a single plasmid that is not self-transmissible. Table 3 depicting the transfer frequencies of various phenotypes further shows that the NisR phenotype is more common than the Lac+ phenotype and this is because of the same reasons mentioned previously.
Jeff Welch also kept records of phenotype frequencies over several years as shown in Table 4. This collection of data has an over-representation of the NisS phenotype, in particular the Lac+ Prt-NisS phenotype is the most frequent of all of the phenotypes. These skewed results can be explained when one considers that this investigation is set up so that each of the possible phenotypes is chosen for plasmid extraction and so the rarer phenotypes appear to be more common than they actually are.
Some of the various phenotypes in Figure 1 relate to the genotype or plasmid composition that would be expected. For example, lane thirteen has the phenotype Lac-Prt+ NisR and has two plasmids of sizes 56kb and 60kb. Proteinase is encoded on the 56kb plasmid and nisin resistance is encoded on both the 60kb and 56kb plasmids. The transconjugant did not have the 40kb plasmid that confers lactose utilization and the Lac-phenotype is fittingly observed. Another transconjugant where the phenotype and plasmid makeup match up is number twenty-three. The phenotype is Lac+ Prt-NisR and the 56kb plasmid encoding proteinase is missing.
The plasmid extraction gel in Figure 1 reveals the presence of plasmids that are of different sizes than the ones found in the donor strain. Different sized plasmids with varying genetic composition can be obtained through recombination events among the plasmids. The transconjugant in lane number nine is Lac+ Prt+ NisS but only has one plasmid that is greater than 60kb. It is likely that the 40kb (Lac+) plasmid and the part of the 56kb plasmid that confers the Prt+ phenotype recombined to form this novel sized plasmid that gives this particular phenotype. It is also possible that the Lac and/or Prt genes recombined with the chromosome of the transconjugant and confer the Lac+ Prt+ NisS phenotype in that way. Recombination events happen when insertion sequences are present flanking certain genes. These sequences are marked for excision from the plasmid and insertion into either another plasmid or chromosomal DNA. An example of a transconjugant where it is likely that a chromosomal recombination event occurred are lane numbers four and five of Figure 1. These transconjugants have 56kb and 60kb plasmids most likely giving them their Prt+ and NisR phenotypes, but there is no 40kb plasmid present that would confer the Lac+ phenotype that is observed. This data suggests that the Lac gene recombined into the chromosomal DNA.
In summary, the nisin resistant transconjugants were more frequent observed because NisR is carried on a self-transmissible plasmid and is also present on more than one plasmid while the other phenotypes, Prt+ and Lac+, were only carried on one plasmid each. Some phenotypes matched up with their expected genotypes, but there were many that did not. Transconjugants with plasmids of sizes different than those present in the donor strain were observed because recombination events occurred.

This experiment used the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, more commonly known as the fruit fly, which is one of the most valuable organisms in genetic and developmental research today. Drosophila has been used for many years in research and its entire genome has been sequenced. The life cycle for the fruit fly is short, ten to fourteen days, with a developmental time of nine days and because of this, experimental results can be generated relatively quickly. Drosophila flies are inexpensive to maintain in the laboratory setting and are easy to manipulate. All of these characteristics contribute to the wide use of this organism in genetic research today.
This experiment aimed to characterize an unknown mutant strain of flies through genetic analysis by answering several questions that this experiment was designed to answer. First, how many of the phenotypic differences in the unknown strain are inherited? And of the inherited traits, how many genes are involved in defining the trait? Moreover, how are the genes inherited, are they dominant, recessive, autosomal, sex-linked or do they have some other inheritance pattern? Finally, where are the genes for the identified traits located on the chromosomes? In order to answer these questions, scoring information from reciprocal crosses between the unknown flies and known wild type flies were coupled with scoring data from crosses with three marker strains that have mutations in genes of known chromosomal locations. Three marker strains were used corresponding to the three main pairs of chromosomes in D. melanogaster (Drosophila has a forth pair of chromosomes but they are very small and do not code for many genes). In order to completely characterize and map any unknown mutations F2 progeny were generated from the reciprocal crosses and the sex chromosome marker cross and male backcross progeny were generated from the two other marker cross progeny.
Another supplemental objective of this experiment was for the experimenters to learn how to work with Drosophila melanogaster. Skills in the handling and maintenance of this frequently used organism are valuable tools to add to a future molecular biologists repertoire.
Eight bottles of unknown mutant flies were obtained and their phenotypes were recorded. Two bottles of wild type flies were also obtained and all unknown and known bottles were cleared of adults. The wild type strain used was Oregon-R (Ore-R) characterized by a gray body, red eyes, and normal wing venation. Virgin females (virgin ♀) and males (♂) were collected from the unknown, wild type, and marker strains. The marker number represents the chromosome number that the known mutations in that strain are on. Refer to the MCDB 306 Genetics Laboratory Manual for further details about these strains.
Reciprocal crosses A and B, and marker crosses I, II, and III were set up in duplicate according to Table 2 Phase I Crosses. Approximately ten females and twenty males were added to each of the crosses described. One hundred flies were scored from each of the F1 crosses before the bottles were cleared and more virgin females and males were collected in order to set up the second round of crosses. In Phase II cross A, B, and marker cross I were used to create F2 progeny by crossing the F1 progeny. Phase II marker crosses II and III were male backcrosses between unknown females and mutant marker males. See Phase II Crosses in Table 2. The scoring results from phase I and II crosses were analyzed and the genetic inheritance pattern, linkage data, and map distances were determined.
The F1 progeny of cross A and B were tabulated, see Table 3. In both A and B crosses, all of the F1 progeny (♂ and ♀) had wild type body color and wild type wing venation which suggests that these mutant phenotypes are recessive. Furthermore, males and females were distributed approximately equally for the body color and wing venation trait in both crosses which suggests that the genes for body color and wing venation traits are autosomal.
Table 3 shows that all cross A females have wild type eye color and all males have mutant eye color. This pattern of inheritance is indicative of a sex-linked gene since males receive only the mutant allele they have the mutant phenotype but females have one wild type allele and one mutant allele so they have a wild type phenotype given that mutant eye color is a recessive trait. Cross A F1 females all inherit one copy of the wild type eye color gene which is enough to confer the wild type phenotype so eye color is a recessive trait. Phase II of the A and B crosses involved a cross between the F1 progeny, see Table 4 for body color and wing venation results.
If body color and wing venation are two allele, recessive, single gene traits with complete dominance then they would be expected to segregate 3:1 wild type:mutant. The body color trait segregated 3.56:1 wild type gray body:mutant black body. A χ2 test was conducted which did not reject the hypothesis that body color is a recessive single gene trait. The wing venation trait segregated at a ratio of 4.4:1 wild type:mutant wing venation and a χ2 test rejected the hypothesis that wing venation is a recessive single gene trait (Skeletal Report 5). This data conclusion is not consistent with the F1 progeny data that showed that wing venation was a recessive trait. However, since only a small number of F2 flies were scored there is a chance of random error which may explain the unexpected result of the χ2 test. Scoring errors or expressivity/penetrance problems of the wing venation mutation could also have been factors in this unexpected result.
Since the genes for body color and wing venation have been characterized as autosomal, another χ2 test was conducted to see whether the two genes were independently assorting. If two genes independently assort then the expected dihybrid ratio of F2 progeny is 9:3:3:1, wild type:single mutant:other single mutant:double mutant. A modified dihybrid ratio had to be created based on the observed F2 ratios in order to more accurately judge independent assortment based on the data generated from this experiment. See Table 5 for the modified expected ratios and expected number of flies for the dihybrid cross compared to the actual observed numbers for each of the four phenotypes. If the genes were segregating independently then a ratio of 15.7 : 4.4 : 3.56 : 1 would be expected; however, there are approximately three times more double mutants than would be expected if the genes were segregating independently which logically suggests that the genes are linked. And indeed, a χ2 test rejected the hypothesis that the genes for body color and wing venation are independently assorting so the alternative is that they are linked. The map distance between body color and wing venation was calculated to be 29.14 m.u. (Skeletal Report 6)
As Table 6 shows, a new orange eye color was observed in the F2 generation and there are only wild type females in cross B F2 progeny. Based on this data, the best hypothesis for the interaction that creates eye color is a two gene epistatic interaction where homozygous white eye mutations are epistatic over homozygous or heterozygous orange mutations. The proposed interaction is:
The expected results based on this hypothesis are that the two genes for eye color are linked on the X chromosome because the F1 data showed that eye color is sex-linked and the only explanation for having only wild type F2 females for cross B is if this is the case. See Page A of the attached Skeletal Report for the details of the crosses and how alleles segregate to give this pattern of inheritance. The map distance between the two eye color genes, w and n, was calculated from cross A F2 data to be 28.57 mu.
Marker crosses II and III were conducted in order to map autosomal genes, which in the case of this unknown included the genes for body color and wing venation. Each of the mutations in the M2 and M3 strains was dominant and homozygous lethal. The marker stocks were part of a balanced lethal system which consisted of a true breeding heterozygote combination of known marker mutations. Crossovers are suppressed in this type of genetic setup and the original Bl L / Cy and Gl Sb / LVM genotypes for marker II and marker III, respectively, were conserved. The initial M2 and M3 marker crosses produced F1 progeny that were expected from the conclusions based on A and B reciprocal cross progeny. All progeny were either Bristle Lobed or Curly in M2 or Glued Stubbled or wild type in M3 because those mutations were dominant in the marker stocks. All F1 progeny had wild type body color and wing venation because these two genes were determined to be autosomal and recessive.
In phase II crosses, F1 males were backcrossed to unknown mutant females and if the recessive mutation showed up with the male backcross progeny (Br L or Cy for marker II and Gl Sb for marker III) and four phenotypes were present in the F1 male backcross progeny, then the gene for the mutation is not linked to that marker's chromosome. If a recessive mutation is linked to the markers chromosome, then the mutant phenotype would not show up with male backcross progeny and only two phenotypes would be present in F1 male backcross progeny. The results of phase II male backcrosses are summarized in Table 7.
Green colored numbers were scored from F1 curly (M2) or wild type (M3) ♂s x unknown ♀s
Black colored numbers were scored from F1 Bristle Lobed (M2) or Glued Stubbled (M3) ♂s x unknown ♀s
Table 7 data from cross II shows that mutant body color and mutant wing venation segregated with the male backcross curly progeny. This means that the body color and wing venation genes are not on the second chromosome. The mutations did not segregate with the Bristle Lobed marker mutations in this experiment, but it would be expected that a larger population of flies would show mutant body color and mutant wing venation showing up together in the F1 male backcross progeny. Cross III shows that mutant body color and mutant wing venation do not segregate with F1 male backcross progeny suggesting that these genes are located on the third chromosome. Two flies were scored to be Glued Stubbled, dark body, white eye, wild type wing venation, marked by an asterisk in Cross III. This unexpected result is likely due to a scoring error.
The mutant wing venation gene was given to be at locus 47 m.u. and was said to have a smaller map distance than the gene for body color. The map distance between the genes for wing venation and body color was calculated to be 29.14 m.u. This information is enough to assign a location on chromosome three to each of these three genes, see Figure 2.
Marker cross I was conducted in order to map sex-linked genes, which in the case of this unknown included the genes for eye color. The mutant marker genes present on the X chromosome are recessive and produce a crossveinless (cv) forked (f) phenotype. The initial M1, M2, and M3 marker crosses produced the expected mutant white eye color male and wild type red eyed female F1 progeny. All M1 F1 progeny were wild type for marker 1 mutations (cv f) since all males received a normal copy of these genes from the unknown female parent.
Based on the analysis of F2 data of crosses A and B the two eye color genes were determined to be linked on the X chromosome. The possible genotypes and phenotypes for Cross I F2 progeny are depicted in Tables 8 and 9 as well as the number of male flies scored in each of the phenotypic categories. Only males were included in this table and in determining map distances because it is only males that carry information about crossover events that are needed to map genes. The female progeny had approximately equal numbers (~64 flies) of red eye and white eye progeny and half that number (34 flies) of orange progeny. Table 8 and 9 are set up as three point crosses with only one of the marker I mutations included in relationship to each eye color gene. Table 10 is a two point cross for the marker mutations (cv and f) that shows the phenotype and number of male progeny in each category.
These two and three point crosses were used to calculate the map distances between cv, f, w, and n on the X chromosome, see Table 11. For calculation details refer to page 11 of the Skeletal Report attached. After finding that the map distance between cv and f was slightly off from the actual known distance, the map distances between all other genes were corrected using the correction factor (43/41.7). The numerator in this factor is the actual distance between cv and f and 41.7 was the experimental map distance. Table 11 shows corrected map distances.
The map distances in Table 11 along with the relative number of flies in each category give enough information to determine gene order. The cv-w and cv-n distances add together to give the distance between w and n which tells that cv is between w and n on the chromosome. In the f-w-n three point cross the least number of flies were found in the orange forked phenotype which was assumed to be the double cross over event. In a double cross over the only gene that will be different from the parental genotype will be the gene in the middle of the two crossovers. The genotype of the F1 female parent was f w+ n+ and the genotype of the double cross over was f w+ n. The gene that is different from the parent is n which means that n is in between f and w.
The locus of each gene was finally determined using the gene order and map distance data explained above coupled with the given locus of gene w at 1.5 m.u.. See Figure 3 for a diagram of the X chromosome and the locus of the eye color and marker I genes.

The fly Drosophila Melanogaster is one of the most studied organisms used in biological research in genetics and is considered a model system for several reasons: they contain only 3 pairs of autosomal chromosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes; the entire genome has been sequenced; they are small and easy to grow in the laboratory; they have a short generation and high productivity; and the males do not show recombination.
The purpose of this experiment was to determine the number of genes involved in each mutant phenotype (white eye color, dark body color, short veined wings veins), the mode of inheritance for these mutations, and the genetic loci of each of these genes. The experiment was carried out in three main steps. Unknown flies with wild type flies underwent two reciprocal crosses to determine the mode of inheritance for each mutation; the analysis of the F1 and F2 generations revealed whether the mutant phenotypes were dominant or recessive and autosomal or sex linked. In the next step, U-5309 virgin females were separately crossed with males from M2 and M3 marker stocks that contained known mutations on autosomal chromosomes 2 and 3 respectively. The F1 males of these crosses were back crossed to U-5309 virgin female flies in order to ascertain the genetic loci of the autosomal mutations. Finally, a cross between U-5309 female flies with male flies of known marker mutations on the X chromosome (M1) was carried out to the F2 generation in hopes of establishing the genetic loci of possible sex linked mutations.
The flies were prepared for observation and handling by anesthetization using CO2. The flies were then transferred to CO2 pad and examined and counted under a microscope. (See pg. 1-6 of lab manual for more details).
Several different strains of flies were used for this experiment: unknown mutant strain U-5309, wild type Oregon R strain, and three marker mutation strains with known mutations. The genotypes and phenotypes for each strain are listed in Table 1.
In this experiment, 5 different crosses were used. In Cross A, Oregon-R males and U-5309 virgin females were crossed to produce an F1 generation. The males and females of the F1 generation were then crossed with each other to produce an F2 generation. Likewise, U-5309 males and Oregon R virgin females were crossed to produce an F1 and F2 generation in Cross B. In a separate cross, Cross I, U-5309 virgin females were crossed with M1 males also to produce an F1 and F2 generation. In Cross II and Cross III respectively, U-5309 virgin females and M2 and M3 males were carried out to the F1 generation, and then the F1 males were backcrossed with U-5309 virgin females. (See pp 19-25 of lab manual for more details)
The F1 data of crosses A and B show the wild type phenotype for body color in both males and females (Tables 2 and 3). This signifies that the wild type phenotype is dominant over the mutant dark body phenotype. The F2 results of crosses A and B show two phenotypes, light and dark body, in both males and females. The presence of both wild type and mutant body color in the F1 and F2 generations indicate that the gene for body color is autosomal. In the F2 generation, there is a sizable majority of light body color over dark body color, which further supports that dark body color is a recessive mutation and independently assorts (Table 4). Chi square analysis was used to determine whether body color is a single gene trait that independently assorts properly to produce a 3:1 phenotypic ratio in progeny. The p value was calculated to be 1.86 x 10-3, which indicates that our data body color is not segregating properly. This either implies that there may be another factor that influences the segregation of body color alleles so that they do not independently assort, or that a larger sample of F2 progeny should be examined to produce more accurate results.
The F1 data of Crosses A and B also show wild type phenotype for wing venation in both males and females. This suggests that the mutant wing venation is recessive and autosomal. Furthermore, the F2 generation shows males and females both containing both wild type and mutant longitudinal wing venation, and also resulted in significantly more wild type longitudinal wing venation (503) than the mutant phenotype (115). This suggests that the gene for wing venation undergoes independent assortment. However, chi square analysis to test if wing venation is a single gene trait that undergoes independent assortment produced a p value of 2.43x10-4, which indicates that wing venation is not undergoing independent segregation properly. This result, similar to body color, indicates that there also may be another factor influencing body color segregation or that a larger sample of F2 progeny should be examined to produce more accurate results.
Chi square analysis was also used to see if longitudinal wing venation and body color genes assorted independently from each other. Using the observed ratios obtained from body color data and wing venation data separately, chi square analysis produce a p value of 0, which led to the conclusion that body color and longitudinal wing venation did not assort independently from each other. Recombination analysis produced a genetic map distance of 42.1 map units between the two genes. (See Appendix for all chi square calculations)
The Cross A F1 results for eye color produced all females with red eyes and all males with white eye color. (Table 2) The females of the F1 generation must all be heterozygous, which shows that the mutant eye color is a recessive mutation. However, since the F1 generation only contained males with white eyes, the gene for eye color was determined to be sex linked; all the males in the F1 generation receive one X chromosome from the mutant female parent, and a Y chromosome from the wild type male parent which does not contain any corresponding wild type alleles. The Cross B F1 results for eye color show both male and female flies with
red eyes (Table 3) This is because the males inherit their single x chromosome from their wild type female parent.
The F2 generation of Cross B produced several different eye color phenotype: red, white, and orange (Table 5). This suggests that there are two genes involved in determining eye color. The appearance of specifically three different eye colors suggests that eye color is controlled by two genes showing epistatic interaction (Figure 2). The high number of mutant phenotype observed indicates that the gene coding for white eyes (a) is epistatic over the gene coding for orange eyes (b). Also in the B Cross F2 generation, only the red eye phenotype was found in females. If the two genes had undergone independently assortment, the females in F2 would contain more than one phenotype. However, females only showed wild type phenotype for eyes, indicating that these two genes are linked. Moreover, the unequal appearance of different eye colors between the male and female flies of the F2 generation in cross B further supports the previous conclusion that the genes for eye color located on the x chromosome. Using recombination analysis, the genetic map distance between the two genes controlling eye color was determined to be 30.0 map units for cross A and cross B combined.
In order to determine the genetic loci of the two linked autosomal recessive mutations of U-5309, body color and wing venation, males from the M2 and M3 balanced marker stocks were crossed with U-5309 virgin females in Crosses 2 and 3 respectively. The crosses produced an F1 generation that showed wild type phenotypes for both wing venation and body color, as expected. Balanced marker stocks are true breeding heterozygous strains that maintain the same genotype through a homozygous lethal system. 50 flies of each cross were scored to confirm that the marker mutations, body color, and wing venation were all assorting properly.
Continuing Cross 2, male F1 flies with lobed eyes were back crossed with virgin U-5309 females. There were not enough progeny from this cross for allow for statistical significance. However, from the few flies that were scored, the back cross progeny showed three distinct phenotypes: light body, normal wing venation, and bristle lobed; light body normal wing venation, and curly wing; dark body, mutant wing, and curly wing. Since dark body color and mutant longitudinal wing appeared with the marker mutations, it indicates that the body color gene and wing venation gene are not located on the same chromosome as the marker mutations, the 2nd chromosome (Figure 1B). The white eye phenotype also appeared with the marker 2 mutations in male backcross progeny, confirming that the genes for eye color are not located on the 2nd chromosome, as expected. The less stable homozygous lethal system of the marker genes along with the exposure of CO2 to the F1 males may account for the extremely low backcross progeny count.
Cross 3 was continued by back crossing male F1 flies with virgin U-5309 females to see if the body color gene and wing venation gene are located on the 3rd chromosome. There were only two different phenotypes observed in the progeny: light body, normal wing venation, glued eyes, and stubble bristles; dark body, mutant wing venation. Only wild type phenotypes for body color and wing venation appeared with the marker mutations glued eye and stubble bristles in the male backcross progeny, indicating that both wing venation and body color genes are both on the 3rd chromosome. It was known that the wing venation mutation is located at 0 on the chromosome
3. Therefore, according to the distance between the two genes previously determined through recombination analysis, the location of the body color gene is at 42.1 map units on the third chromosome, between the genes for glued eye and stubble bristles (Figure 1C).
To discover the genetic loci on the x chromosome of the two genes controlling eye color, virgin U-5301 females were crossed with marker 1 males (Cross I). The F1 generation contained red eyed females and white eyed males, as expected. Among the 50 female progeny of the F2 generation, the phenotype found in the least number was orange eyes. This further supports our conclusion of an epistatic relationship between the two genes. A total of 104 male progeny were scored and 6 phenotypes were observed with the possibility of 8 different genotypes between the three genes: cv, a, b. (Table 6). The phenotypes that occurred twice were corrected to the number of its corresponding recombinant allele in order to account for having two possible genotypes. Since the location of gene a already was already known to be at position 1.5, the distance between gene a and gene cv was used to determine the correction factor. The corrected distances showed that the distance between cv-b was the largest, thus placing gene a between cv and b (Table 7). However, this would place gene b in a location entirely off of the chromosome. Therefore it was predicted that the data collected was not representative of the actual genetic loci of gene b.
Another 3 point cross was calculated to determine the location of the two eye color genes in relation to the known forked bristle gene of the marker mutation. (Table 8). Similar to the cv-a-b cross, the phenotypes that occurred twice were corrected to the number of its corresponding recombinant allele in order to account for having two possible genotypes. The distance between f-b was calculated to be the largest, therefore supporting the placement of gene a between genes b and f. Since the locations of gene a and gene f were both given, the distance between them was used in the correction factor. (Table 9).
One possible explanation for the inconsistent results in the 3 point crosses could be attributed to the difficulty in distinguishing between orange and red eyes of the back cross progeny in Cross I. Also, if more Cross 1 F2 progeny had been scored, perhaps more accurate results could be obtained.
A 2-point cross was also determined between cv-f. (Table 10) Based on knowing the actual gene loci of genes cv and f, it was expected that would be more crossveinless and forked bristled progeny than actually observed. The calculated map distance between the two genes based on our observed results was 3.8, which is significantly smaller than the known 43 m.u. It is not reasonable to use the correction factor of 43/3.8 to correct the values derived from the 3-point crosses because the values calculated would be much larger than the actual chromosome. Scoring more than progeny may have resulted in relatively more recombinant progeny, therefore producing a more accurate distance between the two genes.
Based on previously knowing the locations of genes a, cv, and f, and only looking at the relative positions of the genes to each other, the gene order should be b-a-cv-f. However, the map distances between the four genes given in the point crosses are significantly inconsistent with each other. All three point crosses placed gene b in a location off of the actual x chromosome. Because of these unfeasible results, the genetic distance determined through recombination analysis of Crosses A and B was ultimately used to determine the location of gene b. Since the location of gene a at 1.5 is known, gene b must be located at position 31.5. This would place gene b between gene cv and gene f at positions 13.7 and 56.7 respectively (see Figure 1).
In our experiment, it was determined through crosses A and B that the genes for wing venation and body color are autosomal, recessive, and linked. From the F2 generation of both crosses, the genetic distance between the two genes was calculated to be 42.1. Crosses II and III located gene d and gene sv on chromosome 3. Although Cross II did not produce enough back cross progeny for significance, the data obtained still suggested that genes sv and d were both located on the 3rd chromosome. Therefore, given that the location of gene sv is at 0 on chromosome 3, it was determined that the location of gene d is at position 42.1 of the same chromosome.
Through Cross A and Cross B, it was revealed that our mutant eye color is controlled by two genes that exhibit epistatic interaction. The gene for white eyes is epistatic over the gene for orange eyes. Based on the phenotypes of the F1 and F2 generations, it was found that the genes for eye color are also recessive and sex linked. The two 3-point crosses and one 2-point cross analysis of Cross I resulted in a location for the orange eye gene that was unfeasible. Since the genetic location of gene a on the x chromosome was previously known, the location of gene b was determined to be at position 30.0 based on the recombinant frequencies calculated from crosses A and B. This would place gene b between the marker genes cv and f at 13.7 and 56.7 m.u. respectively.

We used bacterial conjugation to measure genetic distances and observe recombined phenotypes through the use of E. Coli, specifically, an Hfr strain that is F+. This categorization indicates that the bacteria contain a non-attached, transferable sex factor that can be donated to an F-strain, which we introduced through uninterrupted mating. This creates a donor pair, the male is known as a genetic donor, F+ and the female as a genetic recipient, F-. Bacterial conjugation is the formation of a very fragile conjugation tube that creates a canal for the F factor to be transferred. The canal is created through contact of pili from one bacterium to the cell wall of another, known as collision. Next, the bacteria must identify each other as a donor-acceptor pair. Once the conjugation tube has been formed, the transfer occurs. This is an energy dependent, sequential transfer that is unidirectional and proceeds at a slow but constant rate. The selecting gene must then be expressed phenotypically, if they are dominant. Finally there must be integration of the gene into the replicated genome of the accepting bacteria. This specific order of operation sets limitations to conjugation. The gene that is closest to the origin of transfer has the greatest chance of getting into the F-cell's chromosome. The origin of transfer is the point at which a break occurs in the integrated F factor. This is the leading point of the chromosome to be transferred. By selecting for a certain gene that we expect to be transferred and analyzing the amount of bacteria that grew in the specified media, we can determine genetic distances between these genes and are able to tell where recombination about these genes took place.
In addition to thiamine, the following supplements were supplied to the corresponding plates:
To begin the process of conjugation, we mixed 0.2 ml of Hfr culture with 1.8ml of F-culture. We then incubated the mixture at 37oC for 60-70 minutes, this is known as uninterrupted mating. We then took the mixture out of incubation and added 1ml of it to 9ml of nutrient broth for dilution. This created a concentration of 10-1. With a pipette, we transferred 0.1ml from the original solution to three plates, media 1, 2 and 4. We then transferred 0.1ml from the diluted solution to three new plates, media1, 2, and 4. These six plates were then incubated at 37oC for 48 hours. The following day, the plates were scored and 2 master plates were created from the viable colonies, one on media 1 the other on media 2. We chose to create our master plates from the original solution, and allow our dilution plates to be used by other students. These plates were then incubated at 37oC for 24 hours. Once the incubation period had passed, we replicated the master plates onto the above mentioned media plates. The media 1 master plate was replicated to media 2,then 3,then 4,then 5, and finally to media 1. The media 2 master plate was replicated to media 1, then 3, then 4, then 5, and finally to media 2. Once results were observed, the following day, the plates were placed into cold storage until they could be viewed by the GSI.
In this experiment we found that through uninterrupted mating of the Hfr and F-, we get the highest number of viable colonies from the media 2 plate, which selects for Pro+. We then see that the media 1 plate, which selects for TL+, exhibits the next highest number of colonies and finally that the least number of colonies grows on media 4, which selects for Gal+, as supported by the Table III of the appendix. We see from the media 1 master selection plate series that the most number of colonies grew on media 1, selecting as previously mentioned, and media 5, which selects for Met+, followed by media 2, also selects as previously mentioned, then media 3, which selects for Lac+. The least amount of colonies grew on media 4, the Gal+ selecting plate. The numerical data for the media 1 master plate selections can be found in Table IV of the appendix. The data from the media 2 master selection plate series shows the highest amount of growth on the media 2, as well as media 5. Media 3 plate had the next highest amount of colonies followed by media 1, to leave only media 4 as the plate having the fewest colonies. This information can be found with numerical values for colonies in Table V of the appendix.
Through the methods of selection we conclude that the first gene to enter the F-cell is Lac+ gene, which indicates its location as being the closest to origin of transfer. Following the Lac+ gene, in order, we see that Pro+, TL+, and Gal+ enter successively. We determine that the Met-gene from the Hfr was not expressed phenotypically in our recombinants. This is because any bacteria containing this gene, assuming it is dominant, would not have survived our selective media 5. The order of entry of these genes was determined through three criteria found through the analyses of the plates. The first criteria came from our initial uninterrupted data that told us through order of decreasing quantity that Pro+ must be closer to the origin of transfer Than TL+ and Gal+ because the media 2 plate had the most colonies. TL+ comes next followed by Gal+. The second criteria comes from our analyses of the TL+ selection plates which tells us that in this selection, Pro+ must be closer to TL+ than Lac+. The third criteria comes from the Pro+ selection plate series that tells us when selecting for Pro+, Lac+ must be closer to Pro+ than TL+. Through creation of organized tables (please see appendix) of the recombinant phenotypes, we are able to calculate map distances between the genes selected for and those that come between it and the origin of transfer. Table VI in the appendix has the data and calculations for the map distances carefully outlined. Below is a map of our found genetic order of entry as well as the calculated map distances of the selected genes. The discrepancy in the two calculated distances between the TL+ and Lac+ in Table VI is 10 mu. This could be due to the fact that we had more recombinants between crosses 1 and 4 of the media 1 selection than expected and less recombination between crosses 1 and 3 of the media 1 selection. In order to find a perfect correlation between the calculations, we would have needed more colonies that had recombined to give us a TL+ Pro+ Lac-phenotype. We could repeat the experiment to determine whether this was the case or whether there was a discrepancy in the media 2 master selection series. We chose to use the values for the map distances that were shorter because it is known that when we determine map units that the direct distance between genes is more accurate that when calculating a distance that passes over genes.
We can conclude from this experiment that the order of entry is Lac+ first, Pro+ second, TL+ third, Gal+ fourth and Met+ fifth. We can also conclude that the genetic map distance between Lac+ and Pro+ is 24 mu, the distance between TL+ and Pro+ is 36 mu, and consequently the distance between TL+ and Lac+ is 60 mu. We cannot conclude any distances from the origin for Gal+ or Met+ since they entered the F-bacteria after the genes that we selected for.

Drosophila melanogaster is a well-studied species that is easily anesthetized and handled. Because of this, as well as its relatively small genome of four chromosomes and short developmental duration of four days to imago, Drosophila is an ideal species for genetic analysis. The fact that virgin female flies, which are necessary in order to ensure proper genetic crossing, are easily extracted from a newly hatched population due to the innate inability of either sex to mate within the first ten or so hours of life, furthers this attraction to Drosophila as a controlled laboratory experiment. In this experiment we take advantage of these characteristics and use them to identify the genetic locus of specific mutations that cause deviations in the wild type phenotypic eye color, body color and wing venation. This can be achieved by performing five crosses. The parental reciprocal crosses, A and B, are performed to determine whether the mutant genes are sex-linked, autosomal, recessive, or dominate. The parental cross of the unknown virgin females with the males of marker stocks' II, III and I provide verification to the findings of the reciprocal crosses as well as confirmation of known information of the dominate marker II and marker III mutations, and the recessive mutations of the marker I stock. The F2 generations of these marker crosses become useful when determining gene interactions and chromosomal locus. By observing the expressed phenotypes in the F2 generation of the reciprocal crosses, we can determine the number of genes involved in a specific mutation, such as eye color, body color, or wing venation and calculate the map distance between them. We can also use chi-squared testing in order to prove or disprove hypotheses of our findings. If it is concluded that two mutations are linked through a chi-squared test, the map distances between them can be calculated through the well-known techniques as discussed in the MCDB 306 lecture.
The marker I cross can offer information about sex-linked genes and their locus on the first chromosome. With a population from these three crosses combined, we were able to perform more accurate statistical analysis through the chi-squared test and determine genetic linkage or independent assortment of multiple allele genes than with the reciprocal cross F2 generation data alone. The F2 generation of the marker II and III crosses tell us if the mutations are located on the respective chromosome by a lack of simultaneous expressivities of the phenotype. The map distances between the mutations found to be on those genes can be determined through analyzing the recombinant data from the F2 generation of the reciprocal crosses.
Once the flies were carefully removed from their feeding vials, and anesthetized with CO2, they were sexed. Virgin females could be obtained by clearing all flies from the vials and returning to collect and sex them within 10 hours of the clearing. Ten Crosses were then performed, each made in duplicate. Ore-R Drosophila was used as the wild type, U-2544 was used as the unknown mutant stock, and marker stocks I, II and III were used. As a parental cross, U-2544 virgin female were crossed with Ore-R males, this was called Cross A. A reciprocal parental cross was created between the Ore-R virgin females and the U-2544 males, Cross B. U-2544 virgin females were crossed with Marker I males, Cross I. U-2544 virgin females were crossed with Marker II males, Cross II. U-2544 virgin females were crossed with Marker III males, Cross III. Once the F1 generation was scored and analyzed, Crosses A, B, and I were allowed to continue through an F2 generation, with the removal of parents within 7days of set up. Cross II had F1 Bl+ L+ males removed and Cross III had F1 Gl+Sb+ males removed, each to be backcrossed with U-2544 virgin females in new vials. The complete and detailed procedure is described in the MCDB 306 lab manual.
The F1 data above indicates that the gene for body color is recessive. This is due to the lack of the mutant appearance in the F1 generation of both Crosses A and B. It also indicates that the mutation is autosomal due to the appearance of the wild type trait in the males. Had the trait been sex linked, the males of Cross A would have received their only X chromosome from the U-2544 mother and exhibited the dark body phenotype.
The F2 data for body color produced a 3:1 wild type to mutant phenotypic ratio. Since we can conclude from the F1 generation that the gene for body color is autosomal, it is not necessary to account a female to male ratio. For these results we hypothesize a normal segregation for the body color gene. The chi-squared value for this hypothesis was 0.2411. This result, under one degree of freedom, yields a p-value that is greater than 0.5 but less than 0.9. Therefore we accept our hypothesis of normal segregation for body color.
The F1 data for the wing venation is similar to that of the F1 data for mutant body color. The lack of appearance of the mutant trait in the F1 generation allows us to conclude that the mutation is recessive. The fact that the males of the F1 generation of Cross A forces us to conclude that the gene for wing venation is autosomal.
The data for the F2 generation yields a 4:1wild type to mutant phenotypic ratio. For this data we hypothesize a normal segregation of the gene for wing venation. The chi-squared value of 9.67 with one degree of freedom indicates a p-value that is much less than 0.005 and therefore we must reject the hypothesis and conclude that the wing venation gene does not segregate normally, and that it is linked.
The results of body color and wing venation combined produce a ratio that cannot be used to easily conclude whether the two traits are linked or whether they independently assort. Therefore we calculate a chi-squared test with a hypothesis that they do assort independently. With this assumption we calculate a value of 104.305. This result, under three degrees of freedom, yields a p-value that is much less that 0.005 and therefore the hypothesis must be rejected and we conclude that the mutant genes d and w are linked. Knowing this, we can calculate the map distance using the amount of recombinants in the F2 generation. Here we calculated that map distance between d and w to be 44.2 mu.
The F1 generation here provides us with the same information as found for the body color as well as wing venation mutations. We can conclude through the lack of mutant findings in the F1, we can conclude that the mutation is recessive. We can also conclude that it is autosomal due to the fact that the F1 males of Cross A do not exhibit this trait.
The F2 generation provides us with two new phenotypes, according to eye color. The red eye color is wild type and as such a parental phenotype. The same is true for the mutant parental white-eyed F2 flies. From this data we hypothesized that there were two genes interacting with each other in order to produce orange and brown eyes. The two genes o and b are epistatic to each other. This meaning that a wild type Ore-r would have o+_b+_ genes, homozygous or heterozygous, as long as one of each dominate gene were present to create the red eye. This would also indicate that our U-2544 would have oobb genes, homozygous recessive alleles for both genes involved in eye color. From this we state that the orange-eyed phenotype will be oob+_, homozygous recessive for the o gene expressing that it is epistatic to the b+ wild type gene. Similarly, we state that the brown-eyed phenotype will be o+_bb, homozygous recessive for the b gene expressing that the presence of two mutant alleles results in epistasis. Through Mendel's experiments with his peas, it is known that two genes that are independently assorting form a 9:3:3:1 ratio, given that each trait yields a 3:1 ratio. From the high amount of double recombinant phenotype in the F2 generation we can conclude that the genes for eye color are in fact not independently assorting but linked. This can be seen even without doing a chi-squared test by comparing the 9:3:3:1 expected ratio to the 10:1:2:3 found ratio. We calculated the map units between the two genes to be 43.6 mu.
The marker stocks are used in order to verify chromosomal locus. The known mutations are dominant Cy, Bl, and L in marker II stock, and Gl and Sb in the marker III stock. These mutations are known to be homozygous lethal, which form what we call a balanced lethal system. The F1 generation of these marker crosses alone does not tell us anything more than that which we have learned from the reciprocal crosses. When males of the F1 are separated and crossed with U-2544 virgin females, called a male backcross, we can use the resultant phenotypes to determine whether or not the selected trait is on chromosome II or III. Because of the lack of recombination in male Drosophila, we determine that the mutant genes appearing with the marker mutations reveal that they are not on the same chromosome. For example, we found the gene d, dark body, to be located on chromosome III. This was discovered through a male backcross of the marker III F1 progeny. The genotype of the F1 male is Gl+ Sb+ d+/ Gl Sb d, and it is crossed with a U-2544 female whose genotype is Gl+ Sb+ d+/ Gl+ Sb+ d+. Since there is no recombination in male Drosophila, and any recombination in the female would not change the genotype, we can conclude that any progeny would have the wild type allele d+ in its genotype and be dominant over our mutant gene. If the genes were not linked, the fact that there is no recombination between chromosomes in males would be irrelevant. This backcross theory is relevant to any backcross. The results from our marker III male backcross indicates that neither the body color gene, d, nor the wing venation gene, w, appear with the marker III mutations. From understanding of what the male backcross can tell us, we know that these genes must be located on the chromosome III. It is seen that the eye color mutation does appear with the chromosome III mutations and therefore cannot be located on the same chromosome. We then conclude that the genes must be located on chromosome II. This information would be indicated by a backcross of the marker II stock, had it thrived. The cross failure was probably due to over exposure of the sensitive marker II stock to the CO2 anesthetizing agent. Because of this mating failure between any male progeny and the U-2544 virgin females, we must deduce the chromosomal locus through a process of elimination using other experimental and known information. Since we know that o and b are not sex linked, they cannot be located on chromosome I. It is known that o and b are not located on chromosome four. Now that is experimentally determined through male backcross that o and b are not on chromosome III, we can only conclude that they must be located on chromosome II.
Combining the found information of crosses A, B and I provide us with a larger population and more accurate data for eye color analysis. By performing a chi-squared test we can test a hypothesis of independent assortment between the two genes. The result had a value of 277.46 yielding a p-value that was much less than 0.005 and so disproving our hypothesis. From this we can conclude that the o and b genes are linked. We use the recombinant data to calculate a map distance of 45.3 mu between o and b.
From this experiment it is concluded that the eye color mutations are linked and located on chromosome II. The gene o has a genetic locus of 59.2 mu while b has a genetic locus of 104.5 mu. It was also found that wing venation and body color mutations are linked and located on chromosome III. The w gene has a genetic locus of 0mu and d can be found at 44.2 mu. Crosses A and B's F1 generations provided us with the knowledge that the U-2544 mutations were autosomal recessive. The resulting F2 generations from these reciprocal crosses allowed us to perform chi-squared statistical analysis proving that the body color and wing venation genes are linked. The F2 generation data also allowed us to determine that two genes are involved in eye color, that they are epistatic to each other. We also used this data to determine an estimate of map distance between them. The male backcross of the marker crosses was necessary to determine chromosomal locus. In the case of the U-2544, it turns out, only the marker III cross was necessary in determining chromosomal locus. Through this cross, we determined that w and d were located on the third chromosome and that o and b were not. The marker cross I gave us additional information in calculation of the map distance between the two eye color genes. Had our mutant genes been sex linked, it would have been necessary to find the chromosomal locus. The loss of the marker II cross was regrettable but not detrimental to our conclusion that the eye color genes had a chromosomal locus here, due to the fact that Drosophila has a limited genome, one of the main reasons for using Drosophila in genetic analysis. The following maps indicate the chromosomal and genetic locus of the unknown mutations as well as the loci of the marker mutations.

Drosophila Melanogaster is useful as a model organism because it has a short life cycle of 10-14 days. Their short lifespan and small size make it easy to culture and relatively inexpensive to store large numbers of flies. Additionally, numerous mutant phenotypes are easily seen with or without the aid of microscopes so observing and separating the flies is not a painstaking task. Because Drosophilahas a very long history in biological research, there is a tremendous amount known about its genome. The knowledge about wild-type and marker strains will help in identifying where the mutant genes are and how they are inherited.
Ultimately, the purpose of this experiment was to characterize unknown mutations in a mutant strain of Drosophila Melanogaster. The goal was to determine the inheritance patterns of these mutations as well as to locate the specific position of the genes on the chromosomes. By comparing a pure line wild-type strain, known as the Ore-R strain, with the mutant strain, known as U-7812, distinct differences were found in the expression of body color, eye color, and wing venation. To find out how these three different phenotypes were created, various crosses were performed. In order to find out how the mutations were inherited (sex-linked verses autosomal; dominant verses recessive), reciprocal crosses between the Ore-R strain and mutant strain were performed. The progeny of the F1 generation underwent further reciprocal crossing to produce an F2 generation which was used to determine how the mutations are inherited. In addition to these reciprocal crosses, a series of marker crosses were performed using M1 and M3 marker strains (Note: Marker 2 was not available). The marker strains contain mutations with known positions on their respective chromosomes (M1 is the X-chromosome, M3 is chromosome 3), so they could be used to decide whether the marker mutations were linked with the unknown mutations. Female unknowns were crossed with males from the marker strains. An F1 cross was completed for the M1 group, while a male back-cross was performed for the M3 group. These marker crosses provided information to establish linkage relationships of the unknown genes and to assign each gene to a specific locus.
Four different strains of Drosophila melanogaster were used. All of the flies in the stocks are true breeding. The Oregon-R (Ore-R) stock contains wild-type flies have red eyes, complete wing veination, and tan-colored bodies. U-7812, the unknown stock with white eyes, dark body, and incomplete longitudinal veination, was utilized in every cross. The Marker 1 stock had crossveinless (cv) and forked (f) mutations, which are located on the X-chromosome. These mutations were eventually found to be sex-linked recessive. The Marker 3 stock had glued eyes (Gl), stubble (Sb), and LVM mutations, which are located on chromosome 3. These mutations were eventually found to be autosomal dominant. LVM flies express the same phenotype as a wild-type fly would; the actual difference is that an LVM fly has an inversion on chromosome 3. LVM is homozygous lethal and therefore serves as a balancer lethal system in the M3 crosses.
All crosses were performed twice and all protocol in performing the crosses as well as the handling of all drosophila strains can be found in the MCDB 306 lab manual.
All flies were put to sleep using carbon dioxide gas. After all F1 progeny were hatched, 100 flies were scored from crosses A, B, I, and III. After F2 and backcross progeny had hatched, 200 flies from each F2 generation were then scored with phenotype data recorded for all crosses.
The F1 results as shown above support that there is an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance for the mutant alleles for wing venation, body color, and eye color. If the mutations in the U-7812 strain had been dominant, all of the F1 progeny would have expressed the mutated phenotypes. This is because all of the F1 progeny are heterozygous for the mutant gene. Also, if the mutations had been sex-linked, then all of the male F1 progeny would be mutated. This is because males have one X-chromosome from their U-7812 female parent, meaning any mutations would be expressed. Neither of these patterns was supported by the data gathered, but autosomal recessive inheritance of the alleles was supported. Therefore, it can be concluded that all three mutant alleles show an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.
The F1 results as shown above support that there is a recessive pattern of inheritance for the mutant alleles for wing venation, body color and eye color. Like in Cross A, if the mutations in the U-7812 strain had been dominant, all of the F1 progeny would have expressed the mutated phenotypes. Distinguishing between sex-linked and autosomal cannot be done, because it is impossible for either sex to express the mutant phenotype. All F1 male progeny will receive their X-chromosome from their wild-type mother, so males will always express the wild-type phenotype. Females will be heterozygous for the mutant gene. Therefore, from this data, it is only possible to conclude that the genes are recessive. However, with the data from Cross A and Cross B together, it is possible to conclude that the genes are definitely autosomal recessive.
It is already known that crossveinless and forked mutations are sex-linked recessive. For the Marker 1 Cross, all of the progeny were wild-type phenotypically. The females were heterozygous for the mutant genes, and the males were all wild-type because they received the wild-type genes from the wild-type mothers. Therefore, the observed data makes sense.
It is already known that Glued-eye, Stubble, and LVM are dominant mutations on chromosome 3. However, since Gl, Sb, and LVM are homozygous lethal, mutant flies in the stock must be heterozygous at those loci (Refer to skeletal report to see the actual arrangement of the marker mutant genes as their arrangement is crucial for successful backcrosses). This means that the father has the potential to give one of two different genotypes during mating. Since the unknown female is wild-type for the three genes, the resulting F1 progeny should have two different phenotypes in equal ratios. The data gathered reflects all of these facts, because the F1 progeny are about half Glued-Stubble and half LVM expressing. The observed data makes sense.
The data above helped show three major things. First, it showed that the body color gene segregated properly and is controlled by one gene. The data corresponded to an observed ratio of 3.1:1 (wild-type:mutant), which was extremely close to the expected 3:1 ratio hypothesized to arise if there was one gene responsible, and the mutation was recessive. Using X2 analysis, it was supported that body color is inherited through autosomes and that the mutation is recessive. The X2 value of .081 correlated to a probability of 77.6% that the observed ratios would occur due to chance, given the expected ratio. Therefore, body color is autosomal recessive. Secondly, the data showed that the wing veination gene segregated properly as is controlled by one gene. The data corresponded to an observed ratio of 2.96:1 ratio (wild-type:mutant) which again was extremely close to the expected 3:1 ratio hypothesized to arise if there was one gene responsible, and the mutation was recessive. Using X2 analysis, it was supported that wing veination is inherited through autosomes and that the mutation is recessive. The X2 value of .013 correlated to a probability of 90.9% that the observed ratios would occur due to chance, given the expected ratio. Therefore, wing veination is autosomal recessive.
Finally, the F2 data shown above helped determine whether the two genes, body color and wing venation, were linked or segregating independently (combined table found in skeletal report). The data presented showed an observed ratio of 10.9:3.8:3.95:1 which was close to the expected 9:3:3:1 ratio expected for two independently assorting genes with recessive mutations. Using X2 analysis, it was supported that the two genes are assorting independently. The X2 value of .898 correlated to a probability of 82.6% that the observed ratio would occur due to chance, given the expected ratio. Therefore, it was concluded that these two genes are localized to different chromosomes in the genome, so this accounts for the independent assortment observed.
The F2 data showed the expression of four phenotypes for eye color. The expression of the orange and brown phenotypes in the F2 progeny warranted the proposal that there were two genes controlling eye color. With four phenotypes, there must be at least two genes, but, because there are only four phenotypes, there should only be two genes involved. The genes expressing the orange and brown phenotypes were assigned the names gene a and gene b , respectively. The following table shows how the genes interact to produce the different colors.
If the genes were independently assorting, there would be a typical 9:3:3:1 ratio expressed in the F2 generation. The data does not support this, as there are far more white-eyes flies than orange-eyed or brown-eyed. Since having white eyes requires that both genes are homozygous recessive, the genes are unlikely to be assorting independently. The data supports that the two eye color genes are linked, so crossing over may be occurring in the female flies. It makes sense that the brown and orange eyes are least expressed because they are recombinant phenotypes. The map distance between the two genes can be calculated using the combined data of crosses A and B. Orange-eyed and Brown-eyed flies are recombinant phenotypes, so crossing over had occurred in the mother flies. The two genes were shown to be 21.3 map units apart (refer to skeletal report).
A male backcross is used to ensure that crossing over does not take place when it crossed to a pure-line unknown female. Glued-Stubble males were recovered from the F1 progeny, and they were crossed with U-7812 virgin females. Because of the way the genes are set up on the marker chromosome (refer to skeletal report), unknown mutations that are on chromosome 3 will never show up with Glued/Stubble (i.e. genes that are linked on chromosome 3 will not show up with Glued/Stubble). If the unknown mutation is on a different chromosome, then it is possible for the mutation to show up with Glued/Stubble. According to the data above, body color and eye color genes must be assorting independly from Glued/Stubble because the mutant forms of both genes show up with Glued/Stubble. On the other hand, mutant veination is never seen with Glued/Stubble, so wing veination must be on chromosome 3. The body color and eye color genes are therefore on chromosome 2 because they are neither sex-linked (which was found from Cross A) nor linked to chromosome 3.
The data gathered (refer to skeletal report) shows that there is a linkage relationship between eye color and body color. If there had been no linkage, then the double-mutant, white eyes and dark body, would be expressed in the lowest quantity in the F2 progeny of crosses A, B, and I. This was not seen, as there were far more double-mutant flies than the recombinant orange or brown phenotypes. If the genes were not linked, then the expected ratio is 9:3:3:1. Using X2 analysis, it was supported that the two eye color genes are linked on autosome 2. The X2 value of 341.6 correlated to a probability of much less than 5% that the observed ratio would occur due to chance, given the expected ratio. This means the hypothesis of independent assortment must be rejected. This confirms that the eye color genes are linked on chromosome 2. With the combined data, it was found that the map distance between the eye colors was 18.9 map units.
Performing a three-point cross established the map distances between the linked genes of eye color and body color. Refer to the skeletal report to see a table with data for the three-point cross. By dividing recombinant phenotypes by the total number of flies, the map distances between genes could be calculated. The calculations showed a 9.8 mu distance between body color and gene a, a 10.4 mu distance between the body color and the gene b, and 20.2 mu distance between gene a and gene b. Mapping of these genes to their assigned chromosomes was accomplished by acquiring the location of one of the genes. The other genes were then mapped in relation to that gene.
The data presented above provides the organized conclusions of this experiment. It was shown that body color and eye color are linked on chromosome two, and that the wing venation trait was present on chromosome three.

In the field of plant biology, one of the fundamental processes of life is photosynthesis. This process occurs through the fixation of carbon dioxide in the presence of water and may or may not require light (photosynthetic dark reactions can occur in the absence of light). The end result of photosynthesis is the production of organic materials, such as sugars and oxygen, which are necessary for the life processes of many organisms. Although the majority of plants carry out photosynthesis, they do so at different rates. The rate of photosynthesis is dependent upon several environmental factors, including temperature, amount of light present, amount of carbon dioxide present, and the color of the light. In this lab, the purpose was to manipulate one environmental factor to determine the effect on the process of photosynthesis. It was decided that the environmental factor to be tested would be the concentration of carbon dioxide initially present. Then a hypothesis was generated: An increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide initially present will lead to an increase in the rate of photosynthesis, and as a result, an increase in the amount of oxygen generated. Throughout the experiments, the aquatic plant Elodea was used to carry out photosynthesis. This particular plant is especially conducive to scientific experiments involving photosynthesis because of its ability to produce oxygen bubbles as it carries out photosynthesis, making it simple to monitor the rate of photosynthesis in an experiment.
In this experiment, all other possible environmental factors, such as temperature, were kept constant, while the environmental factor to be tested was varied. To test the original hypothesis, different concentrations of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), a source of carbon dioxide, were used. Approximately three one inch sections of Elodea were cut with a razor blade. As the method of examining the rate of photosynthesis was counting the number of oxygen bubbles produced by the plants, special attention was paid to cutting the stem of the Elodea at an angle so that carbon dioxide bubbles could escape properly. Three graduated cylinders were each filled with 10 mL of solutions of 0.2% sodium bicarbonate, 0.1% sodium bicarbonate, and 0.0% sodium bicarbonate (pure water). These concentrations were accomplished by diluting a stock solution of 0.2% sodium bicarbonate with distilled water. All solutions used room temperature distilled water; therefore temperature was not a factor that was tested in this experiment. The three pieces were placed in the individual graduated cylinders. The number of bubbles that broke the surface of the water for each cylinder was counted during a five minute time period, and the results were recorded in a data chart. This was repeated for a total of five trials, with new pieces of Elodea being cut for each trial. During each of the trials, a bright lamp stationed approximately one foot away was aimed at the three cylinders to help stimulate the process of photosynthesis.
For each of the five trials, the rate of photosynthesis was measured by counting the number of oxygen bubbles that was produced by the Elodea plant. Bubbles were counted as they traveled up the cylinder and broke the surface. Table 1 shows the data chart for the number of bubbles observed at each particular concentration of sodium bicarbonate in the five trials.
Afterwards, the average number of oxygen bubbles observed for each concentration of sodium bicarbonate was calculated. This data can be seen below in Table 2. It was observed that the rate of photosynthesis steadily increased as the initial concentration of sodium bicarbonate increased.
As shown by the data in Tables 1 and 2 in the Results section, the number of oxygen bubbles generally increased as the initial concentration of sodium bicarbonate increased. Thus, one can conclude that the rate of photosynthesis is directly related to the concentration of sodium bicarbonate. The results seen in this experiment are therefore supportive of the original hypothesis presented in the introduction of the paper. Since sodium bicarbonate acts as a source of carbon dioxide, one of the required starting materials for the process of photosynthesis, it was expected that solution with more sodium bicarbonate, and this more starting carbon dioxide, would lead to the production of more oxygen compared to a solution that had no sodium bicarbonate in it. Comparing the results seen with 0.0% and 0.2% sodium bicarbonate solutions (Table 1 and 2), it is apparent that there is a much greater amount of oxygen produced with the addition of more carbon dioxide at the start of the experiment. The average number of bubbles for pure water is less than 1, while the average for 0.2% sodium bicarbonate is 10.8 bubbles.
Based on the data shown in Table 1, it is evident that not every trial yielded ideal results. For instance, the results of Trial 2 show that the 0.2% sodium bicarbonate yielded 3 oxygen bubbles, an atypically low number for that particular concentration. Neither the 0.1% of the pure water solutions yielded any oxygen bubbles. There are several possible explanations for these results. As the rate of photosynthesis is measured by the amount of oxygen escaping in the form of bubbles from the stem of the Elodea plant, it is possible that there were problems with the stems of the plants. They may not have been cut at a sharp enough angle to allow the bubbles to escape, of they may have been blocked by some particles that were present in the plant. As the number of bubbles depends on the eyesight of individuals, it is also possible that human error is involved. Tiny bubbles of oxygen may have escaped the notice of the individuals performing the bubble counts.
In relation to the question of how photosynthesis is affected by the initial amount of carbon dioxide present, it would be interesting to further explore how different concentrations of sodium bicarbonate can increase the rate of oxygen produced. In the experiments described in this paper, a stock solution of 0.2% sodium bicarbonate was used, so higher percentages of sodium bicarbonate could not be tested. Therefore, it would be useful to try percentages of sodium bicarbonate such as 0.5%, 0.75%, and 1.0%. Based on the results seen in this experiment, one would expect that increasing the percentage of sodium bicarbonate present would lead to an even greater increase in the rate of photosynthesis, and correspondingly, more oxygen bubbles produced. However, one would also expect that once the maximal rate of photosynthesis is reached, adding a higher concentration of sodium bicarbonate would not affect that rate of photosynthesis.

Drosophila Melanogaster, commonly known as fruit fly, was the organism studied in this experiment. Drosophila were ideal because they were small and had a life cycle of about 10 to 14 days. This allowed for many generations to be produced from crosses. Drosophila are diploid organisms that only have four pairs of chromosomes which includes three pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. Drosophila were also ideal to study because they possess traits, which can be observed with a microscope, that were characteristic of the sex and genotype of the flies. In this experiment the pattern of heritance and the genetic loci of the mutations in body color, eye color, and wing venation in an unknown strain u4184 of flies. The unknown strain was crossed with a wild-type strain in a set of reciprocal crosses to determine if each trait was recessive or dominant and autosomal or sex-linked. The unknown strain was then crossed with three strains that each had different known marker mutations. The results from the F1 generation of these crosses and the results from their subsequent male backcrosses or F1 x F1 cross determined on which chromosomes the genes for body color, eye color, and wing venation were. The genetic distance between these genes was determined by the results in the F2 generation of the reciprocal crosses combined some of the results from the marker crosses by calculating the percentages of recombinants and parental types.
During the first lab period, the traits of eye color, body color, and wing venation were observed in the unknown strain and wild-type strain using the microscope and CO2 according to the procedure described in the lab manual. The unknown flies had whit eyes, dark brown body color, and wing venation with short longitudinal veins. The wild-type flies of Ore-R had red eyes, tan body color, and wing venation with longitudinal veins that went to the end of the wing. During this time the differences between the female and male flies was determined. The male flies have rounder abdomens with the last two dorsal segments darkly pigmented, genital claspers ventrally on the abdomen, and sex combs on the first pair of legs. The female flies have pointier abdomens with dorsal triangular dark pigmentations and lack genital claspers and sex combs. After observing, two new cultures of unknown flies were made with about 15 females and 20 males each. The cultures bottle was placed on its side until the flies wake up so that they do not get caught in the food and die. These new cultures supplied a fresh source of unknown flies for later weeks during the experiment. Shortly after this, the adult flies in the eight unknown bottles and three wild-type bottles were cleared. Eight hours later 80 unknown virgin females and 20 wild type virgin females were collected as described in the lab manual on page 20. Clearing the adults and then waiting no more than eight hours to collect the females ensured that the females were virgins because they were not mature yet for mating with the males.
The next step in the experiment was setting up the set of reciprocal crosses and the marker cross using the collected virgin females. The first cross was Reciprocal Cross A which consisted of 15 unknown U4184 virgin females and 10 wild type Ore-R males. To perform the crosses the same procedure was used as described in the lab manual for the culture, but in this case the flies were from two different strains instead of one strain. The vials for each cross were labeled for identification. The second cross was Reciprocal Cross B which consisted of 15 unknown U4184 males and 9 wild type, Ore-R females. The third cross performed was Marker Cross I, which consisted of 25 males from marker stock I and 10 unknown U4184 females. The marker I male flies had the genotype cv f on their only X chromosome, which produced a phenotype of cross veinless wings (with allele cv) and forked bristles (with allele f). These mutations are sex-linked, recessive. The fourth cross was Marker Cross II which consisted of 30 marker stock II males and 10 unknown U4184 virgin females. The marker stock II males had the phenotype of short thin bristles (with allele Bl), lobed eyes (with allele L), and curly wings (with allele Cy) and a genotype of Bl Bl+ L L+ Cy Cy+. The fifth cross was Marker Cross III and consisted of 30 marker stock III males and 10 unknown 4184 virgin females. The marker stock III males had a phenotype of smooth ("glued") eyes (with allele Gl) and short, blunt bristles (with allele Sb) and a genotype of Gl Gl+ Sb Sb+ LVM LVM+. The LVM gene did not produce an effect on phenotype.
One week later and once the vials all had a sufficient amount of pupae, the parents from all the crosses could be removed, killed with CO2, and disposed in the fly morgue. Because the fly life cycle is about 9 days, this step removes the parental generation and prevents breeding between the parental and F1 generation. During this time, the phenotypes of the marker crosses (which were noted above) were observed under the microscope so that offspring could be scored correctly. Also 40 unknown virgin females were collected according to the same procedure done before.
The next step in the experiment was to score the F1 generation of all five crosses and make a record. The scoring took looked at the phenotypes for sex, body color, eye color, wing venation, and the marker mutations. At least 100 flies from Reciprocal Cross A, at least 100 from B, and at least 50 each from Marker Cross I, II, and III were scored.
After scoring, the second round of crosses was set up. For Reciprocal Cross A 30-40 male and female flies from the F1 generation were taken and put into a new bottle to make a F1 x F1 cross. This was done again to make a duplicate. The same was done for Reciprocal Cross B and Marker Cross I and their duplicates. For Marker Cross II, first a cross was made between 30 bristle, lobed males of its F1 and 10 unknown 4184 virgin females, and then a second cross was made between 30 curly males of the F1 and 10 unknown virgin females. For Marker Cross III, a cross of 30 glued, stubble makes from the F1 and 10 unknown virgin females was made and duplicated. These crosses for Marker Cross II and III are known as male back crosses. And one week later the adults were removed just as in the first round of crosses. Finally, the last step in the experiment was to score the F2 generation and the male back cross progeny according to their eye color, sex, body color, wing venation, and marker mutations.
The results from the Reciprocal Crosses A and B in the F1 and F2 generations shed light o the genes controlling eye color, body color, and wing venation. The reciprocal crosses allowed for the determination of the traits as sex-linked or autosomal, and dominant or recessive. For example, if a trait were autosomal, then the progeny of both Cross A and B should be the same because it would not matter which parent had which genotype since each is passed on equally to both sexes of children. This is not true for a sex-linked trait, in which the son inherits the x chromosome and its genes only from the mother. These crosses F1 offspring also indicated whether the traits were dominant or recessive, because the offspring of these pure-breeding lines would show the dominant allele in their phenotype. The results for the F1 and F2 generations for the Reciprocal Crosses A and B are discussed individually below for body color, wing venation, and eye color.
From Cross A F1, the dark body color gene can be determined as autosomal, recessive. It is recessive because all the F1 is wild-type. This indicates that the wild-type allele masks the mutant dark color allele. The trait is autosomal because both the males and females are wild-type. If the trait were sex-linked then the males would be mutant because they would only have one X chromosome which they inherited from their mutant mother from a pure-breeding line. The F1 from Cross B only indicated that dark body color trait was recessive because the males would be wild-type even if the trait were sex-linked since they would inherit a normal allele on the X chromosome from the mother. The results form the F2 generations of Crosses A and B determined if the dark body trait alleles were segregating properly. If this data were tabulated again to look at the ratios, the following would be observed:
Upon Chi-Square analysis, the chi-square value was 4.38 with a p-value less than 0.05. This indicated to reject the hypothesis of light body color being completely dominant to dark with no more segregation the two alleles for body color. The rejection may have been because the dark body mutation does not have 100 % penetrance, or perhaps during scoring the newly hatched dark bodies were scored as light instead of dark.
Based on the F1 results of cross A, the mutant wing venation can be determined as a recessive, autosomal trait based on the same reasoning used for the body color trait. The F1 results from Cross B only determined the trait as recessive, as it did for the dark body color gene. The F2 results determined if the alleles for the wing venation were segregating properly. Once the F2 results were combined and looked at in ratios, the hypothesis of normal segregation for a complete dominance of wild-type wing venation over the mutant could be tested. The following is the combined ratios:
The chi-squared value for this test was .0176 with a p-value between .5 and .9. Thus, the hypothesis of complete penetrance and dominance of wild type wing venation over the mutant venation with no more segregation between the alleles cannot be rejected.
To test if the alleles for wing venation and body color were independently assorting or if the genes were linked, the two traits have to be looked at together in the F2 results from the Crosses A and B combined. These numbers must then be made into ratios that can be compared to the expected ration for independent assortment. The ratio for independent assortment of the alleles for wing venation and body color must be derived from the obtained ratios, obtained earlier, of the segregation of the individual traits. The observed and expected ratios are tabulated below. Wt indicates wild-type, and m indicates mutant.
The chi-squared value for testing the hypothesis of independent assortment was .628 with a p-value between .5 and .9. Thus, the hypothesis of independent assortment cannot be rejected. The genes for body color and wing venation were not linked.
From the same reasoning used for the determination of body color and wing venation, the results from the F1 of cross A determined eye color as a autosomal, recessive trait, while Cross B F1 determined eye color as just a recessive trait. Looking at the F2 results for the eye color trait, however, made this trait a bite more complicated than the others. When observing the F2 of Crosses A and B, four eye colors were identified. There was red, white, and also brown and orange. Because there were four different eye colors, there could be two genes involved in the expression of eye color. Because there are two genes involved, the F2 results will determine the interaction between these two genes; the F2 results will conclude if the genes were linked or not. A hypothesis for the possible interaction is described by the following diagram:
The presence of the a+ allele with the b+ allele complements to make the wild-type red eye color. However, brown was possible with the genotype of aab+_, orange was possible with the phenotype of a+_bb, and white was aabb. The data eye color from F2 of Crosses A and B is tabulated below.
The marker II and III stocks were balanced marker stocks to keep the heterozygous stocks pure line. The pure-line was established with a balanced lethal system, in which being homozygous for the mutant alleles was lethal. For example, flies in marker stock II had a one chromosome 2 carrying Bl L Cy+ and another chromosome 2 with Bl+ L+ Cy. These alleles are for the dominant, autosomal traits of short thin bristles, lobed eyes, and curly wings, respectively. When a male and female from marker stock II mate, the offspring with both chromosomes carrying Bl L Cy+ are killed and so are those both carrying the Bl+ L+ Cy chromosomes. Recombination among the genes in the chromosomes were controlled by inversion, an introduced cross-over suppressor for females, and males do not undergo recombination. This balanced marker system was also used in marker stock III with their chromosomes: one carrying Gl Sb LVM+ and the other carrying Gl+ Sb+ LVM.
Marker Cross II and III used male backcrosses instead of F1xF1 crosses. In a male back cross, the male progeny from the F1 are selected and mated to certain homozygote genotype female (in this case an unknown virgin.) In Drosophilia, male flies do not under go recombination. By selecting the males form the F1 generation and using the homozygous unknown females, recombination should not occur. These crosses also used male back crosses so that all the offspring would be viable. This was true for the kind of backcrosses employed in this experiment because an unknown female was always used. The unknown female carried the wild-type alleles for the marker mutations and would pass them on to the offspring. So the male back cross offspring would never be homozygous for the lethal marker mutations. The back crosses conducted would indicate which genes were on the marker chromosomes 1, 2, and 3. If a certain mutation does not show up with a marker mutation in the male backcross progeny, then that mutation is linked with the marker mutation, and thus on the same chromosome. This is a result because no recombination should occur in a male backcross in Dosophilia. However, if the mutation does show up with the marker mutation in the back cross progeny then this would be a sign that the two mutations are not on the same chromosome. In this experiment Cross II did not produce any male back cross progeny, but the results for Cross III male progeny are below.
The mutant body color of dark brown and mutant eye color of white showed up with the glued eye and stubble bristle marker mutations, and this means that neither the body color gene or eye color genes were on the third chromosome. However, the mutant wing venation of four short longitudinal veins did not show up with the glued eye and stubble bristle mutations, so the wing venation gene was on the third chromosome.
The results from the F1 of Cross A determined that the eye color genes were autosomal. From Marker crosses II and III, the placement of gene for wing venation was found to be on chromosome 3, while body color was not. Since body color was not sex-linked, the gene for body color must be on chromosome 2 (since chromosome 4 does not carry many genes.) The same was true for the two eye color genes. Another clue that the eye color genes and body color gene are on the same allele was the fact that only 13 white eyed light body and 69 white eye dark body F2 progeny were observed for the crosses A, B, and I combined. This was very different from the expected results associated with independent assortment of about ¾ of the white eye progeny to be light body and only ¼ to be dark bodied. In a tree-point cross between d-a-b (d is allele for dark body, a and b are alleles for eye color), the distance between genes was found by doubling the number of recombinants because the F1 x F1 crosses hides half of the recombinants. The distance between d-b was found to be 10m.u, a-b was 39.5 m.u, and d-a was 49.5 after taking the twice the number of double crossovers into account. Thus, d and a were on the ends and b was in the middle.
With the information from the five performed crosses and the information of the location of one mutation of the chromosomes given by the instructor, the genes for mutations for dark body color, mutant wing venation, and eye color may be mapped on the chromosomes of the Drosopholia .

Organisms are constantly altering their diets in response to food ability, competition, predation, and a multitude of other factors. How do organisms physiologically change in response to variations in diet? Which physiological processes are affected when an Alaskan brown bear switches from a low protein diet of wild berries and roots to a protein rich diet of salmon returning to spawn? Countless other examples exist in nature where organism experience annual, seasonal, and daily differences in food availability. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the effects of dietary protein deficiency on the size, and thus the function, of various organs in mice. The organ chosen for this study were the heart, pancreas, and testes, which play a crucial role in circulation, digestion, and reproduction. Adequate circulation is absolutely necessary for the transfer and removal of nutrients and wastes under any condition. Therefore, the prediction was made that regardless of dietary protein intake the mass (an indirect measure of organ function) of the heart would be maintained. In contrast, maintenance of the pancreas was expected to decrease during protein deficiency, since its major role in digesting dietary protein is non-essential under these conditions. The main focus of interest is the question of whether the mass of the testes of mice will be maintained when faced with protein deficiency. One could argue that reproduction is a non-essential life function and thus would be turned off when resources are in low supply. On the other hand, in terms of evolution the success of an organism is measured by its genetic contribution to the future. If environmental conditions appear unfavorable an organism may sacrifice its own health and biological needs in order to reproduce. A classic example of this occurs every year as salmon migrate upstream to their original riverbeds to spawn and soon after die. It is hypothesized that in mice facing protein deficiency mass of the testes will be maintained, since in nature mice have a rapid turnover rate and the success of the future generations may take priority over individual success. This issue can be more broadly applied to the field of ecology by observing how changes in diet effect organ growth. Prolonged periods of protein deficient diets may be a problem for organisms that inhabit temperate or artic regions where certain nutrient rich foods are not available throughout various time of the year. It is also interesting to infer the impact of diet on reproductive life histories.
The 8 mice used in this experiment were on a 12/12 hour light/dark cycle and kept at room temperature during the duration of the study. 4 days prior to the tissue harvesting, ½ of the mice were randomly selected and were switched from the standard University of Michigan rodent chow (LabDiet; Richmond, VA) to a isocaloric, but protein deficient chow (Dyets; Bethlehem, PA) and were given free access to the chow until the completion of the study. At the completion of the study, the mice were killed using carbon dioxide and the target organs were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Measures of the body mass of the mice were taken before the harvesting of tissue and measures of the organ weight were taken prior to tissue homogenization to give the organ wt/ body wt ratios.
Measures for total protein content in the organs was determined by homogenizing 100mg of tissue in 2ml of solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5mM MgCl2 and immediately sonicated for 15secs to further disrupt the tissue. Following the sonication the total protein content was determined spectrophotometrically using BioRad protein dye. Measures of the total DNA content were measured using a luminescence spectrometer and a DNA quantification kit from Sigma-Aldritch.
Equal amounts of protein were run on a SDS-PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and afterwards transferred to a nitrocellose membrane. The membrane was blotted with milk for 1 hr and rinsed to remove any non-specific binding. Subsequently, placed overnight into a solution containing antibodies for GAPDH or s6p (a ribosomal protein). The following day the membranes were rinsed and incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 hr, washed, and developed using enhanced chemoluminescence. Electronic images of the membranes were taken and used for comparison of control and protein deficient tissue.
In the pancreas the mean organ wt/ body wt ratio in the control condition was 7.51 ± 0.62 (mg/g), whereas in the protein deficient mice the mean organ wt/ body wt ratio was 5.53 ± 0.77 (mg/g) (Figure 1). Differences between the control and protein deficient mice were statistically significant and had a p-value of 0.007 (Table 1). In the heart the organ wt/ body wt ratios were 5.17 ± 0.24 (mg/g) in the control condition and 5.33 ± 0.31 (mg/g) (Figure 1). The heart wt/ body wt ratios in the control and protein deficient mice are very close and have a statistically insignificant p-value of 0.459 (Table 1). The ratios of organ wt/ body wt in the testes in the control and protein deficient mice were also statistically insignificant having a p-value of 0.572 (Table 1). In the control condition the organ wt/ body wt ratio was 6.57 ± 1.23 (mg/g), whereas the protein deficient mice had a slight larger ratio of 7.13 ± 1.41 (mg/g) (Figure 1).
To gain insight into the types of changes protein deficient organs undergo measurements of the total DNA (a rough estimate of cell numbers) were taken to determine if protein deficient organs contained less total cells and/or equal number, but smaller cells. In the pancreas, the mean values for the control condition was 0.82 ± 0.10 (mg/tissue) and the mean value in the protein deficient condition was .80 ± 0.09 (mg/tissue) (Figure 2). The numbers are not statistically significant and have a p-value of 0.769 (Table 1). In the control condition of the heart a mean value of 0.26 ± 0.08 (mg/tissue) was measured and a mean value of 0.22 ± 0.05 (mg/tissue) was measured in the protein deficient mice (Figure 2). A statistically insignificant p-value of 0.404 was determined for the heart tissue (Table 1). The p-value of 0.637 determined in the testes was also statistically insignificant (Table 1). The measure of the DNA content in the control condition of the testes was found to be 0.51 ± 0.12 (mg/tissue) and a similar average value of 0.55 ± 0.09 (mg/tissue) was found in the protein deficient mice (Figure 2). In all three organs no significant change in DNA content was observed.
Measurements of the total protein in the different organs yielded results similar to those found in the organ wt/ body wt ratios. In the control condition of the pancreas a mean value of 38.43 ± 5.68 (mg/tissue) was observed and a mean value of 18.13 ± 1.96 (mg/tissue) was observed in the protein deficient subjects (Figure 3). A significant p-value of 0.001 was found between the control and protein deficient conditions of the pancreas (Table 1). In the heart a mean value of 76.00 ± 13.4 (mg/tissue) was measured in the control and a mean value of 68.63 ± 4.30 (mg/tissue) was found in the protein deficient condition (Figure 3). The similar mean values in the heart lead to an insignificant p-value of 0.336 (Table 1). In the testes a difference between the control mean value of 65.60 ± 20.94 (mg/tissue) and the protein deficient mean value of 45.85 ± 9.19 (mg/tissue) was noticed, but a p-value of 0.135 failed to reject the null hypothesis (Figure 3, Table 1).
In the immunoblot for the protein gapdh there are no clear differences in protein expression between the protein deficient and control mice (Figure 4). This is likely attributed to the fact that gapdh performs various housekeeping activities, and is thus conserved. In the immunoblot for the protein s6p, a ribosomal protein, it is clear that protein expression in the pancreas is less in protein deficient mice in comparison to the control mice (Figure 5).
Much research has been done looking at the effects of nutritional stress on the body. For example, in a study on California voles it was observed that their choice of diet varied in breeding and non-breeding seasons. After giving the voles feed with differing nutrient content, it was inferred that nutrition plays an important role in reproduction (Batzli, 1986). Researchers hypothesized that various nutrients play a key role in an organism's reproductive success. The voles used in this experiment were fed either a diet consisting of grass seeds or a laboratory chow. The chow and seeds fed to the voles differed in concentrations of calcium and sodium, but not protein (Batzli, 1986). Voles fed the low calcium and sodium grass seeds reproduced less than voles fed a standard laboratory chow (Batzli, 1986). This experiment led to the belief that reproduction may be affected by an organism's diet.
Another study looked at effects of nutritional stress on sperm production in moths. In the study, the sperm count of moths fed a low-protein diet was compared to the sperm count of moths fed a normal protein diet (Gage and Cook, 1994). The results indicated that diet played a significant role in spermatogenesis as lower sperm counts were found in moths fed a low protein diet. However, the size of the individual sperm cells was unaffected (Gage and Cook, 1994). My results that testes size was maintained during protein deficiency do not fit the findings of this study, but the difference in results may be due to the use of different organisms with different reproductive strategies.
In the following study the relationship between survival and reproduction was looked at in zooplankton undergoing starvation. In the experiment it was found that in starvation conditions some species ceased reproduction and had higher survival rates, whereas some species maintained or increased energy allocation towards reproduction and had lower survival rates (Kirk, 1997). Furthermore, the results indicated that allocating energy production decreases resistance to starvation (Kirk, 1997). These findings suggest that if energy is devoted towards reproduction in times of low energy availability, individual fitness is decreased. However, if an organism fails to reproduce, genetically speaking, it makes no contribution to future generations. In species with a short life span like mice, individuals may die before environmental conditions become more favorable. This is why it was predicted that protein expression in testes would be maintained in mice fed a protein deficient diet. This study highlighted the fact that organisms possess different strategies for reproduction and determining whether reproduction will be maintained or decreased is dependent on the organism's life history.
Yet another study examined the effects of dietary protein on rats. In the study, pregnant rats were either fed a standard laboratory chow or an equal calorie low protein chow. The offspring of the rats fed the low protein chow had a lower mean body weight than rats born from mothers who were fed a normal protein chow (Snoeck, 1990). These results led to the assumption that in protein deficient rats, proteins from various parts of the body were being broke down for use and thus, contributed to the lower body weight in the offspring of pregnant rats fed a low protein chow. These results were additionally supported as a lower mean mass of 29.8 (g) was observed in protein deficient mice, in comparison to the mean mass of 29.8 (g) in the control mice.
Moreover, the effects of protein efficiency were observed in the protein synthesis in the livers of rats. The subjects used for research were either fed a standard laboratory chow or a low protein chow and the effects of protein deficiency were quantified by measuring the concentrations of mRNA in the rat livers (Pain, 1978). A significant decrease of mRNA concentrations was observed in the protein deficient mice (Pain, 1978). The fact that liver functioning decreased in this study led to the assumption that other organs would shrink in response to protein deficiency.
In taking all the studies into consideration, protein deficiency causes lower mean body weights as proteins from organs are broken down in order to maintain vital life functioning. The prediction that regardless of dietary condition the functioning of the heart would be maintained was supported. In all the measurements used to infer organ function ability (organ wt/ body wt, total DNA and protein content) no significant differences were observed between the control and protein deficient subjects. This is more than likely attributed to the fact that functioning of an organism's heart is crucial for its survival. If the heart fails to work properly a myriad of problems exist as a result of poor circulation. Metabolic waste and byproducts of respiration must be maintained at low levels in the body, otherwise the ability of an organism to adequately function is severely jeopardized. Furthermore, cells through the body need a stead supply of nutrients (glucose, O2, hormones, etcetera) need to be circulated throughout the body, and thus, due to its importance in circulation it was predicted that heart function would be maintained.
The results also clearly supported the prediction that functioning in the pancreas would decrease in protein deficient mice. A statistical difference was observed between the experimental and control mice in the organ wt/ body wt values and in the total protein content. This is more than likely due to the fact that one of the key roles of the pancreas is the digestion of protein and in the mice fed a no-protein diet digestion of protein was not necessary. If an organism is protein deficient, proteins within the body will be broken down in order to synthesize other proteins critical for survival. Interestingly, in the measures of total DNA content no statistical difference between the control and protein deficient mice was observed. Since DNA is localized in the nucleus of cells, measurements of the total DNA content of an organ gives a rough estimate into the number of cells. The similar means of total DNA in the pancreas and the rather large difference in total protein suggests that while the numbers of cells appear to be the same, the overall size of the cells seems to be decreasing in protein deficient mice.
The hypothesis that reproduction would be maintained during protein deficiency was supported by the results. The argument that when faced with an environmental stress reproduction would be shut down until conditions improved, was not statistically supported. However, although not significant, a decrease in the total number of protein was observed in protein deficient mice. The standard deviation for the testes was extremely large due to the small sample size and having a larger sample size may have yielded significant differences. Despite the problems associated with sample size, the results indicated that reproduction is high on the hierarchy of biological functions.

Parasites in nonhuman animals offer insight in understanding and treating human parasites, and are thus frequent subjects of scientific study. Avian species of malaria were the first models for studying the biology of the human Plasmodium (Slater 2005). In fact, they are so similar that for a long time, there was doubt as to whether the parasites of bird and human malaria were really different (Manwell 1935). Studies by Waters and colleagues (1993) showed that Plasmodium
Previous studies have also attempted to compare the parasite-host relationship of avian and human malarias, plus evaluate the evolutionary dynamics of a system of many hosts and several multihost parasites (Gandon 2004). Co-evolution between the malaria parasite and its bird hosts have also been of interest. For example, studies of the Hawaiian Honeycreeper suggest that avian parasites do not hinder their hosts' reproductive success possibly because of evolution (Kilpatrick 2006). In addition, another Haemosporidian Leucocytozoon in ducks has been studied for its effects on brood size (O'Roke 1934).
However, avian Plasmodium in Northern Michigan has not been studied in much depth. Its prevalence in the birds should be between 10 and 30% (Feldman et al. 1995). The current study attempted to examine the possibilities of a trend in the incidence of various species of Plasmodium in groupings of birds according to species, age, sex, or size. Furthermore, prevalence of blood parasites in passerine birds were compared to those found in Mergus merganser based on previous findings of Haematozoa in Michigan (DeJong et al., 2001).
Data collection was carried out from July 10 to August 3, 2006 in Emmett County, Michigan. Birds were caught using mist nets, which were arranged in a loop formation with ten nets per loop. There were a total of three sites where birds were captured: NOMA (North Maple River), CEMA (Central Maple River), and SOMA (South Maple River). Data of every bird captured were recorded into organized data sheets, including information such as species name, age, sex, and net number. If blood was taken from a bird, the blood smear number was also recorded. A total of 189 blood samples were taken from a variety of birds; 159 of these were obtained through mist-netting, and the rest were obtained with help of Harvey Blankespoor.
Blood samples were taken from birds' feet using sterile lancets, and then slides pre-cleaned with acid ethanol were held against the small droplet of blood. The blood collected on these slides was smeared with the edge of another slide, then fixed in methanol to be stained later in the lab. Each fixed slide was immersed in Coplin jars containing Giemsa stain for 15 seconds, placed in distilled water for 15 seconds, and finally, rinsed quickly in two more jars of fresh distilled water.
Dried slides were viewed using the 100x power oil immersion lens. Observation of malaria within the blood cells was carried out by manually scanning the surface of the slide for five minutes (roughly 1000 red blood cells).
Prevalence of infection was determined by dividing the number of infected passerine birds by the total number of passerine birds examined. Overall prevalence was determined by dividing the number of infected birds by the number of total birds examined. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to calculate differences of the distribution of avian blood parasites and the intensity of infection between age, gender, and location of the species sampled. These helped to determine any relationship between age or gender and a particular infection and these analyses were done in SPSS 14.0 for Windows.
The total prevalence of blood parasites in the samples was 23.8%. Table 1 summarizes the data of the 14 families of birds that were examined. The family Parulidae was most represented in the sample, but the Anatidae had the highest overall prevalence of infection and prevalence within the family. The family Parulidae also had the highest prevalence of infection within the mist-netted birds (Table 2, Figure 1). At species level, the Baltimore Oriole and Common Grackle had the highest prevalence of parasitic infection, then the Song Sparrow was next highest (Table 3, Figure 2).
Most of the birds caught were in their hatch year age, which also had the highest prevalence excluding the group of five birds which were of unknown or indeterminate ages; no birds of the second year category were found to be infected (Figure 3).
Birds caught at the CEMA banding site had the highest prevalence of malarial infection, and the birds of the NOMA banding site had the lowest (Figure 4). Mann-Whitney Tests resulted in two-tailed p-values of 0.001, 0.762, and 0.003 for comparisons of prevalence between NOMA and CEMA, CEMA and SOMA, and NOMA and SOMA, respectively (Tables 4, 5, and 6).
Kruskal-Wallis Tests regarding bird age, location, and families resulted in p-values of 0.259, 0.004, and 0.009, respectively (Tables 7, 8 and 9). Tests for sex showed no significant differences between male and female.
The data from this study show that prevalence of avian malaria in Northern Michigan was statistically significant. The prevalence of infection in all of the samples collected was 23.8% and the prevalence in only passerine birds was 10.7%, which supports previous research that blood smears demonstrate infection rates between 10 and 30% (Feldman et al. 1995).
Prevalence among species also varied dramatically. One factor that may explain the variance is habitat preference of infected bird species. Mosquitoes are found much more often near standing water, which suggests that birds nesting and breeding near standing water should be more susceptible to avian malaria. The Ovenbirds of the family Parulidae are common in all woods with dry floor; the Northern Waterthrushes are mainly in conifer bogs, wooden swamps, and along streams in heavily shaded ravines; the Black-and-White Warblers are common in conifer bogs; the Nashville Warblers are common in moist conifer woods and bogs or open, dry woods; the American Redstarts are common in deciduous woods. The Hermit Thrush of the family Turdidae are common in semi-open woods, and the Veeries are common in densely shaded, often moist woods. The White-throated Sparrows of the family Emberizidae are common in the shrubby edges of conifer bogs and heavily shaded coniferous-deciduous woods, and the Song Sparrows are common in brushy areas. Black-Capped Chickadees of the Paridae family are commonly found in wooded areas. The Baltimore Oriole of the family Icteridae is common at the edges of open deciduous woods, and the Common Grackle is common near lakes and streams, particularly where there are pines and other conifers. (Pettingill 1974). Overall, some of the infected bird species prefer habitats that are potentially mosquito-dense while others do not.
There was a propensity for prevalence of infection to decrease with bird age except for birds in their second year (Figure 3). These data were inconsistent with previous findings which showed juveniles to be more susceptible to infection than adult birds (Atkinson and Van Riper 1991). Birds should be highly vulnerable to insect bites during the two weeks until they leave the nest because of their bare, feather-less skin, allowing an opportunity for them to be infected by Plasmodium. The small sample size of this study most likely limited the accuracy of the data; with a larger, more thorough sample, one would be able to better interpret the relationship of host age and haematozoan infection. Prevalence of infection was also high in the group of birds with unknown age, since only two out of only five birds were infected.
The prevalence of infection at the three banding locations differed from one another, and was statistically significant. This could be a result of birds having varying degrees of exposure to the mosquito vector. Birds caught in mist nets near water should show a higher prevalence of infection than those caught elsewhere. Possibly, the CEMA and SOMA locations had more mosquito-rich areas in it, and as a result reflected a higher prevalence of bird malaria in the data.
Tests for different prevalence in sex showed no significance, which is a result of inadequate data. Many of the birds caught in the mist nets could not be characterized for sex, because they were too young and juveniles are difficult to assess gender even with the expertise of collaborators of this project.
Prevalence of Haemosporidian infection throughout the birds of Northern Michigan varied significantly by host family, species, age, and location. There are many possible factors that could contribute to this: bird behavior, habitat, concentration of mosquito vectors, climate, or co-evolution (Atkinson and Van Riper 1991). Further studies that look into this would be useful in comparison to distribution patterns of Plasmodium species that infect humans. No conclusions could be made about the effect of Haemosporidians on the bird populations of Northern Michigan, but continued pursuit of this question could supplement data and make more accurate analyses possible.

Lastly, the University of Michigan Biological Station deserves credit for making this project possible.

Acer saccharum, the sugar maple, is a shade-tolerant, gap-phase species (Walters 1993). The growth of A. saccharum seedlings is typically restrained entirely by the limitation of light penetrating the forest floor by the canopies of overstory adult trees (Ricard et al., 2004). The seedlings persist on the forest floor as small juveniles for many years and grow quickly to fill gaps in the canopy created by disturbance (Marks and Gardescu 1998). The species has evolved phototropic responses to canopy gaps that allow it to avoid shade and quickly fill new gaps before its competitors (Brisson 2001). While in temperate North American forests A. saccharum is often found in conjunction with Fagus grandifolia (which is an even more shade-tolerant species), A. saccharum tends to out-compete F. grandifolia in the presence of very small canopy gaps by producing many short lateral branches that more effectively exploit these openings (Canham 1989).
The relationships of several phenotypic responses to light gaps have been examined, including stem orientation (King 2001), leaf structure and biomass allocation (Osada et al., 2004), root architecture (Cheng et al., 2005), and lateral branching (Canham 1988). Though a recent study showed that trees, particularly shade-tolerant species, displace their canopies away from their neighbors to reduce competition and maximize resource exploitation (Muth and Bazzaz 2003), the tendency of sugar maples to branch early and form two trunks to fill the forest canopy more effectively has not been examined specifically. This experiment sought to demonstrate the effects of canopy density and light competition on the tendency of sugar maples to exhibit forked trunks. We hypothesized that trunk forking would allow sugar maples to fill canopy gaps more quickly and efficiently than a single trunk by creating a wider canopy area to absorb the light energy in these gaps and shade out nearby competitors. We expected that a forked trunk would be more effective than a single trunk at filling larger canopy gaps, while a single unforked trunk would be sufficient to fill smaller gaps.
We tested our hypothesis by comparing local basal area per sample area around forked and unforked sugar maples from three sites that differed in species dominance and overall basal area. We predicted that each site would have significantly different proportions of forked and unforked trees and that mean local basal area per m2 would be significantly lower for forked trees than unforked trees. In addition we predicted that each site would have a significantly different mean local density for forked trees.
We sampled three sites: Grapevine Point, Sedge Point and Colonial Point. We selected these sites because they had significant populations of sugar maples but varied in species composition and overall basal area. In each site we established a 50m by 50m test area. We sampled each test area with five parallel 2m by 50m transects. We established these transects within the test area at a distance of 10m from one another measured from their centers. We used the following parameters in the sampling:
Within each transect we recorded the dbh and species of each tree. Every sugar maple encountered was recorded as being forked or not-forked, and we established a point-quarter system around the trees with one axis parallel to and the other perpendicular to the transect. Within each quarter we located the nearest neighbor and recorded its species, dbh and distance to the sugar maple.
We repeated these methods identically for each of the three sites. We calculated the relative dominance and basal area of each site from the transect data. We calculated the mean local density and basal area around forked and unforked sugar maples from the point-quarter measurements separately for each site and for all the sugar maples sampled in the study.
We used an ANOVA to analyze whether the mean local density for sugar maples differed between the three sites. We used a chi-square test to establish whether the proportion of forked and unforked sugar maples in the three sites was identically distributed to test the hypothesis that the sites would have significantly different proportions of forked and unforked trees. We used a t-test to examine whether the mean local density differed significantly for forked and unforked sugar maples for all the sites considered as a population. We examined this difference for the sites considered individually with additional t-tests.
Colonial Point was dominated by relatively large trees and the understory was open with no light gaps and few recently fallen trees. The trees at Sedge Point tended to be much smaller and the understory was crowded with saplings of Acer and Fagus. The trees at Grapevine Point were intermediate in size and there were a few saplings rising to fill recently created light gaps. Because there was more distance between trees at Colonial Point and there were fewer trees overall, its basal area was almost equal to that of Grapevine Point. Though the trees were smallest on average at Sedge Point, this site had a substantially higher basal area than the other two because there were many more trees present (Table 1).
Colonial Point was dominated by very large old beeches, and several smaller red maples and sugar maples were growing between them (Fig 1). Colonial Point had the lowest dominance of sugar maples of all the sites. Sedge Point had an almost equal balance of dominance by red maples, sugar maples and beeches (Fig 2). The beeches at Sedge Point tended to be smaller than the maples but there were more beeches overall. Grapevine Point was different from the other two sites in that over 50% of its basal area was accounted for by sugar maples. Unlike the other two sites, there were no adult beeches or red maples, and several large ashes and basswoods were present (Fig 3.)
The difference in basal area per m2 around the sugar maples between the three sites was statistically significant with a p-value of 0.013, however only the difference between Sedge Point and Colonial Point was significant (Table 2). All of the sugar maples at Colonial Point were unforked, while 47% of the sugar maples at Sedge Point and 24% of the sugar maples at Grapevine Point were forked (Table 3). The difference between these proportions was statistically significant with a p-value of 0.03 (Table 4).
Unforked sugar maples had an average local basal area per sample area of almost double that of the forked sugar maples (Table 5). This difference was statistically significant for the sugar maples of all three sites considered together, with a p-value of 0.007 (Table 6). This difference was statistically insignificant for Sedge Point (Table 7) and Grapevine Point (Table 8) considered individually, with p-values of 0.172 and 0.084, respectively.
The results of the ANOVA (Table 2), which showed that the mean local basal area per m2 of all sugar maples was only significantly different between Sedge Point and Colonial Point, are in reality not very meaningful because all the sugar maples at Colonial Point were unforked. It would be more meaningful to compare the local basal area per m2 for all forked sugar maples or for all unforked sugar maples between the sites, however this would almost definitely be statistically insignificant because of the small sample sizes. The importance of this comparison is questionable because we would expect there to be variation in these numbers between sites based on differences in overall basal area in each site. In addition it would seem logical to compare the local basal areas per m2 of sugar maples with the overall basal areas per m2 at the sites, as lower values for the basal area around sugar maples would illustrate their preference for canopy gaps. However it would be unsound to make this comparison because we calculated basal area per m2 in the transects and around the sugar maples using different sampling methods. The use of different sampling methods can lead to drastically different estimated densities, particularly when distribution is non-uniform (Engeman et al. 1994).
Because the canopy at Colonial Point was dominated by very tall, old trees that cast a thick uniform shade over the forest floor, it is not surprising that there were no forked sugar maples there. While it would seem unusual that the highest incidence of trunk forking occurred at Sedge Point (Table 3) where overall basal area was highest (Table 1), this site would also tend to have the most gaps because the trees in this site had lower basal areas and smaller canopies. This is supported by the fact that the difference between local basal area per m2 for forked and unforked sugar maples was higher for Sedge Point than Grapevine Point. Furthermore average local basal area per m2 for the unforked sugar maples at Colonial Point was close to the values for unforked trees at the other two sites (Table 5).
If the study were repeated, photometer readings would be taken randomly at several points in each site. Though more light would not reach the forest floor on average, a higher value for standard deviation in these readings at Sedge Point would show that this site has more canopy gaps than the other two sites. Likewise we would expect that though the similar values for basal area at Grapevine Point and Colonial Point should lead to similar mean light intensities at ground level, a lower standard deviation at Colonial Point would reflect a uniformly shaded environment for maple seedlings.
The fact that the difference between mean local basal areas per m2 was statistically significant for all sites considered together (Table 6) but insignificant for the sites considered individually (Tables 7 and 8), despite the fact that the means were almost identical for each site (Table 5), shows that the sample sizes were too small in this experiment. If the study were continued, doubling the sampling regime at each site would probably lead to statistically significant results. This would further establish the role of trunk forking as an evolutionary adaptation of Acer saccharumto quickly fill light gaps.
Our study showed that trunk forking allowed sugar maples to fill large canopy gaps more completely. This was an original finding, however it was consistent with previous research. Shade-tolerant trees produce more lateral branches in canopy gaps (Canham 1989), and orient these branches towards areas with higher light (King 2001). Therefore in large canopy gaps trees tend to expand their canopies by producing several large radiating branches (Canham 1988). If two or more of the branches of a developing tree were highly successful in capturing light, it would be logical for them to continue to develop upwards towards different areas of the light gap and eventually form distinct trunks with individual canopies. The leaves of these canopies would detect light competition by means of the red to far-red irradiance ratio (Aphalo et. al 1999) and the branches of the tree would behave autonomously and avoid one another (Brisson 2001). At this point the canopy of one trunk would respond to shading by the canopy of its other trunks exactly as it would to shading from neighboring trees (Muth and Bazzaz 2003), and orient its trunks away from each other and neighboring trees to minimize the interaction between canopies. As long as the individual canopies were successful in capturing light, all the trunks would be maintained with their canopies oriented away from each other to minimize competition and exploit all available light.
Further support for our results could be provided by long-term studies in which the development of sugar maples is observed over time. Sugar maples would be grown under experimentally created canopy gaps with known values of canopy closure, and the incidence of forking could be observed to determine a threshold gap size under which forking is induced. Based on our observations we would expect that the threshold local basal area per sample area needed to induce forking would be somewhere between 0.00222 and 0.00408, however the experiment outlined above would give a threshold value for canopy closure which would be more relevant because this value more accurately represents the light environment in the microhabitat of a seedling (Jennings et al. 1999).
It is interesting to note that we observed several sugar maples which had trunks that forked, but one or more of the trunks was dead and rotting. The dead trunks always pointed into the canopy of a tall nearby tree. This suggested that the dead trunks had been aborted because their leaves were not receiving enough sunlight because they were being shaded out by a taller neighbor. A long-term study, perhaps performed as a follow-up to the one described above, could be performed to observe this process and determine that in fact the trunks die in response to their gaps being filled by surrounding taller trees, and not the other way around. This would be done by blocking sunlight to one of the trunks of several forked sugar maples and seeing whether the trees abort entire trunks in the same way that they abort unproductive smaller branches.
Trunk forking is an adaptation that has evolved in certain canopy gap-dependent species that improves their competitiveness and overall evolutionary fitness. Tree species with the ability to alter their form in response to their light conditions have an advantage and will tend to outcompete those that are morphologically rigid in settings where environmental heterogeneity is high. An improved insight into trunk forking as a response to light gaps will increase understanding of forest succession and tree species' adaptations to varying conditions.

There are many reasons by which Drosophila Melanogaster is a model experimental model for genetic study. The first of which deals directly with the life cycle of this small insect. Only lasting 9 days, new generations are able to be generated quickly and coincide well with the timing of MCDB 306 class. Furthermore, as female flies can lay as many as 500 eggs in 10 days, the necessary population size for genetic analysis can be created and maintained. Another very important facet of Drosophila Melanogaster is the fact that upon emergence from pupa the female does not reach sexual maturity until approximately eight hours. This allows for the collection of virgin females for further crosses. There are also significant genetic advantages in using D. Melanogaster as well. Foremost is the fact that male flies do not undergo recombination and thus drastically reduce the complexity of scoring future generations. Additionally, the fact that this type of fly only has four chromosomes is also helpful in decreasing the number of chromosomal marker crosses.
The intent of this experiment was to identify the correct chromosome, locus, and mode of inheritance for three unique mutations through the use of designed crosses and statistical analysis. Given the dramatic increase in genetic study, experience in locating unknown mutations within a genome can be very helpful in real world laboratories. This understanding was obtained via careful adherence to established laboratory protocol. The isolation of virgin females and the ability to produce viable crosses with the selected flies was a vital piece in the overall goal of establishing a chromosomal map of unknown mutations. This could be determined only after performing a series of specific genetic crosses between precise populations of D. Melanogaster. Cross A and B were designed to determine if the mutations were dominant or recessive, while cross A showed if the mutation was autosomal or sex linked. For the crosses designated as marker, after executing the initial parental and F1 crosses, F1 backcrosses were performed with flies originating from specific marker populations exhibiting mutations with known loci. As each marker cross utilized populations of flies with different known mutations as well as cross over suppressing inversions, using the principles of independent assortment, though the observation of the progeny from these crosses, allows for the determination of the correct chromosome. A mutation's location on a chromosome can be obtained by statistical analysis of three point crossovers of three mutant traits.
With exception to a few altered details the overlaying procedure for this lab is described in depth in the MCDB 306 Lab Manual. The major difference is that due poor viability, the marker 2 cross was not performed. As a result only four crosses were performed. Virgin females were used when necessary in order to have a controlled cross as the female cannot have already been fertilized by a male prior to the initiation of a new cross. The crosses performed are outlined in the chart below. Additionally in preparation of the marker one and three backcross an initial cross of unknown virgin females and the respective maker males was performed.
From the F1 results noted above several conclusions can be drawn from the analysis of the progeny from both cross A and B. As in both crosses no mutant phenotypes were observed, one could determine that the mutation for dark body is in fact recessive. Furthermore, from cross A one is able to determine that this same mutation is autosomal. This is due to the fact that, were the mutation for body color located on the X chromosome, all male flies would receive only the mutant allele from their mothers, as the female in the cross is homozygous for the mutation. This cannot be determined from the B cross as the females in this cross will always provide an allele with a wild type gamete.
From the F2 results noted above, it was determined that the mutation for body color undergoes normal Mendelian segregation and consists of only one gene. This was determined by the analyzation of the ratios of wild type to mutant flies. The observed ratio as noted in the skeletal appendix was 3.35:1. With this ratio being close to the typical Mendelian ratio of 3:1 a chi squared test was performed in order to make sure the hypothesis of normal segregation is not to be rejected. Obtaining a X2 value of 1.18 with a degree of freedom of one and a probability greater than 0.05, it was clear that one would fail to reject the hypothesis of normal segregation.
From the F1 data noted above it is clear that like body color, wing venation is also a recessive mutation found on an autosome. This can be supported by the fact that both the F1 progeny of cross A and B resulted in exclusively wild type flies being justified in a fashion similar to body color. Furthermore, similar to body color, one can conclude that the mutation is autosomal as all male progeny of Cross A were wild type for wing venation.
From the F2 results noted above, similarly to body color, it was hypothesized that this mutation undergoes normal segregation in a Mendelian fashion. Despite this, the observed ratio of wild type to mutant flies however was four to one compared to the expected ratio of three to one for normal single gene inheritance. Upon obtaining a X2 value of 7.67 (degree of freedom 1) and a probability less than 0.05 the hypothesis cannot be accepted. Despite this, it is possible that due to the variance in expressivity of the wing venation mutation a counting error may have occurred, thus accounting for the rejection of the hypothesis.
In consideration of the relative location both wing venation and body color, as well as whether or not these mutations assort independently or are linked, it is necessary to analyze the phenotypic ratios. As shown above, the observed phenotypic ratio was 9.7 : 2.6 : 2.1 : 1, while the expected ratio of 13.43 : 4 : 3.35 : 1 was derived from the individual observed phenotypic ratio of each separate mutation. Having an initial hypothesis of independent assortment for each gene, a X2 test was performed. The obtained value was 6.13 and with a corresponding probability of greater than 0.05 (three degrees of freedom) one would fail to reject the hypothesis. Therefore, one can assume the two individual mutations are not linked and undergo independent assortment in a Mendelian fashion.
From the F1 data obtained from the A and B crosses it was once again possible to establish that eye color was recessive and autosomal. This is due to the fact that in both cross A and B there were no mutant flies observed, illustrating once again the same pattern seen in the previous mutations of being recessive. Furthermore, from cross A it is possible to again determine that as there are no males exhibiting the mutant eye color the mutant phenotype is not on the X chromosome for the previously stated reasons.
From the F2 results it becomes clear that due to the presence of more than two phenotypes, there must be multi gene control over eye color. In the F2 generation eye color was not limited to red and white, but rather orange and brown became evident among progeny. With a hypothesized genotypic and phenotypic relationship seen below.
From analyzation of the obtained data a hypothesis of two linked genes was proposed. One can justify the linkage, as were the two alleles for eye color assorting independently a ratio of 9:3:3:1 would be observed in actuality however, a ratio of 5.98: 1: 1.2: 1 for red: white: brown: orange. Were independent assortment occurring the ratio of orange and brown would be expected to be significantly larger than that of white. Given that they are linked the map distance between the two alleles was determined to be 48.1 mu.
The male backcross allows for the determination of whether or not a mutation is located on a certain chromosome. One is first required to perform a cross between a virgin mutant female and a male from an individual marker stock. The male progeny from this cross are then mated with unknown virgin females. Upon examination of the progeny from this cross, one can conclude that if the mutation in question can be observed with the marker mutations, then due to the principles of independent assortment the unknown mutation cannot be on the same chromosome as the marker mutations. Consequently if the unknown mutation is not observed with the marker mutations then one can assume that the mutation is on the same chromosome. Due to the low viability of marker stock II it was required that data for this cross be extrapolated from results throughout the lab.
From the given data, as the mutation for body color is not observed with the glued stubble marker for chromosome three, it can be concluded that this gene is on the third chromosome. Analyzation of the extrapolated data of marker cross two shows that both wing mutation and eye color are not observed with the maker mutations of Bristle Lobed or Curly. This can be determined since previous data concluded that these mutations are not sex-linked. Also from the data obtained from marker cross III it is clear that these mutations are not on chromosome three as they are observed with the marker mutations. Finally, chromosome four is eliminated as a possibility as it was stated that no unknown mutations were located on chromosome four.
Through the use of the previous marker crosses, it is clear that the two genes along with wing venation were on chromosome two. Due to the linked nature of the eye color genes and wing venation, one can use the frequency of single and double crossovers to determine the order and map distance of the genes in question. As seen calculated in the skeletal report appendix, the map distance between wing venation and mutant gene a was 89.9 mu. The distance between wing venation and b was 41.9 mu and the distance from gene a to gene b was 48 mu. Therefore the final gene order on chromosome two would be wing venation at 3.8 mu gene b at 45.7 mu and gene a at 93.7 mu.
The final assignments of each unknown mutation is as follows
From cross A it was determined that each mutation was in fact autosomal. This was due to the fact that as the female in the cross was homozygous for each displayed mutant phenotype, were any of the mutant genes on the X chromosome, all male progeny would receive only the mutant gene and consequently express the mutant phenotype. As this was not the case, it is clear that each mutation was autosomal. From both cross A and B it was clear that as all F1 progeny were wild type, each mutation was recessive. From the F2 progeny of crosses A and B it was also made clear that body color was controlled by one gene and sorted independently. Wing venation, although controlled by one gene assorting independently from body color received a chi squared value that corresponded to a probability of less than 0.05 consequently rejecting the hypothesis of normal segregation. This error is most likely attributed to a counting error resulting from the varying expression of mutant wing venation. Marker Cross I, as it was already determined that no mutations were sex linked, instead was used to determine, along with cross A and B the mode of inheritance for eye color as well as the linkage between the two genes controlling eye color. From this information it was determined that eye color was controlled by two genes were only when both were homozygous were white eyes observed, when either gene a or b was homozygous the eyes were brown or orange respectively. Marker backcross III provides evidence regarding the chromosomal location of the dark body mutation, as it was not observed with the marker mutations in any progeny. Through extrapolation it was determined that both wing mutation and the two genes for eye color were located on chromosome two.

Michigan forests have experienced fire as a result of natural causes, Native American agriculture and intense logging in the 1800s (Burt Barnes pers. comm.). After 80 years of fire exclusion, land managers have reintroduced fire in the form of prescribed burning in an effort to maintain fire-adapted ecosystems and combat invasive species. It is important to understand the impact of fire on small mammal populations and communities because these animals (Muridae, Soricidae) play a variety of important roles in forest ecosystems, such as feeding on invertebrates, seeds, fruit, and lichen, disseminating seeds and mycorrhizal fungi, and serving as prey for a number of avian and mammalian predators (Carey and Johnson 1995).
Clearcutting and burning can drastically alter ecosystems, with the most severe fires burning much of the vegetative cover and soil organic matter. Because recently burned ecosystems lack dense cover, they tend to experience higher maximum and lower minimum temperatures than older stands, which can make the habitat unattractive to sensitive mammals (Kozlowski and Ahlgren 1974). The presence of downed woody material, which provides cover, moist microenvironments, runways, burrow sites and a substrate for food, leads to higher recolonization rates for rodents and insectivores during the first 10 years after burning (Fisher and Wilkinson 2005). Additionally, the redevelopment of vegetation structure is associated with the reappearance of small mammal species (Whelan 1995). Some mammals may utilize the edge of plots because they prefer to exploit multiple habitats (Kozlowski and Ahlgren 1974).
Post-fire forest succession influences small mammal population and community composition. Species richness of small mammals increases over time, but levels-off after the first 30-40 years (Whelan 1995). In early successional habitats, the lack of complex/layered vegetation may result in interspecific competition that was not present before the fire, leading to reduced numbers of all species and a change in dominance (Kozlowski and Ahlgren 1974). A source-sink scenario has been observed in some low-quality habitats created by fire, with more recently burned areas being dominated by non-reproducing individuals (Ecke et al. 2002; Buech et al. 1977 in Fisher and Wilkinson 2005).
We selected a chronosequence of naturally and experimentally burned plots at the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS) to investigate the relationships between post-fire succession and small mammal communities. Through live-trapping, we looked for changes in the abundance, diversity and community composition of small mammal species across the burn sequence. Additionally, we measured the age structure and reproductive status of individuals within each plot to look for the existence of a source-sink scenario. We also surveyed the vegetative cover and coarse woody debris (CWD) in each plot, which can be more important than the age since burn (Simon et al. 1998), so as to provide a mechanistic explanation for any observed differences in small mammal composition.
Our study was conducted on a chronosequence of experimental and natural burn plots (see Fig. 1) located on UMBS property (Section 32, T37N, R3W; Cheboygan Co., northern lower Michigan). We chose five plots about 1 hectare in size-one from 1917 that burned naturally and four experimental burns (1936, 1954, 1980, 1998). All experimental burn plots were clear-cut, with the poor-quality timber and slash left on-site and burned. The 1998 burn also includes a deer exclosure and has undergone yearly aspen ramet clipping in some portions. The entire burn sequence is located on a high-elevation outwash plain characterized by excessively-drained, acidic, sandy soil. Pre-settlement, the area was an eastern white pine-red pine-eastern hemlock-northern red oak forest, but extensive logging and 40 years of frequent fires resulted in the dominance of Bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata) in early successional forests, and it maintains a noticeable presence in older forests as well (White 2000).
Figure 1. The 1998 Burn included a 50x80 deer exclosure. The 1917 plot was located to the south of the 1948 plot and to the west of the 1954 plot
We used a point-centered quarter sampling method (Anderson 2006) to survey canopy and subcanopy trees in each plot. Four transects 50m long and at least 10m apart, with 10m between point trees, were laid on each plot. From each point tree, we recorded the diameter, distance from point tree and species of one canopy and one subcanopy tree encountered in each NW, NE, SW and SE direction.
Coarse woody debris (CWD) was surveyed along 4 transects in each burn plot. Transects were 50m long and at least 10m apart. We counted any piece of downed woody material greater than 3cm in diameter that crossed a transect and noted its size category: 3-10cm and >10cm.
Trapping grids were set-up on each plot. For plots 1917-1980, trap lines were laid every 10m until reaching the edge of the plot, and folding Sherman live-traps (22.9 × 7.6 × 8.9 cm; H. B. Sherman Trap Co., Tallahassee, Florida, USA) were placed every 10m along the lines until reaching the plot border. We used the same procedure in the 1998 plot except no traps were laid in a 50x80 restricted area in the middle of the plot and some trap lines had portions located within the deer exclosure fence. The 1917 plot was 100x100m with 121 traps, the 1936 and 1954 plots were 70x80m with 72 traps, 1980 plot was 60x100m with 77traps, and the 1998 plot, excluding the restricted portion, was 5000 m2 with 69 traps.
Trapping was conducted for three consecutive nights starting 24 July 2006. Traps were laid out after 7pm the first night and loaded with oats. Each morning after 7:30am, traps with animals in them were removed during the day for processing, and empty traps were closed. We also noted the number of closed but empty, disturbed or missing traps in order to monitor the level of predator interference.
For each captured animal, we recorded the species, gender, reproductive status and weight. Additionally, a small portion of fur was clipped from a position on the back corresponding to one of the 5 plots, allowing us to determine if the animal was a recapture in the following days. Peromyscus and Tamias species were given oats and apples during the day, and Blarina were given worms. After 7:30pm, processed animals were returned to their trapping station, and all traps were re-set and loaded with oats.
All statistical tests were performed using SPSS 14.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). Statistical comparisons were either a Chi-square test or a Spearmann Rank Correlation with a significance level of P ≤ 0.05. The data collected on recaptured animals was not included in the analysis.
The following species were encountered during our point-centered quarter sampling of the plots: Bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata), Northern red oak (Quercus rubra), Red maple (Acer rubrum
The percent coverage by the most abundant tree species correlated well with the year of the burning in the plots. The percentage of P. grandidentata in a plot was significantly positively correlated with the year of the plot (Rs=0.9, P=0.037). Both the percent composition of Pinus spp. and Q. rubra were negatively correlated with the year of the plot (Rs=-1, P=0.000; Rs=-0.8, P=0.104). Acer rubrum also generally increased (Rs=0.7, P=0.188) with the year of the plot.
We captured a total of 136 individuals (not including recaptures) and 3 different species. Peromyscus leucopus (n=118) was the most abundant. We also captured a few Tamias striatus (n=15) and Blarina brevicauda (n=5; may include recapture).
On average, 49% of all captures on the 2nd and 3rd days were recaptures. All P. leucopus recaptured had been captured earlier in the same plot, except in the 1917 plot, where P. leucopus males were recaptured from the 1980 and 1954 plots as well. One Tamias captured in the 1980 plot was recaptured from the 1998 plot, but all other Tamias were recaptured in the same plot as their first capture. The majority of all recaptured individuals (77%) were non-reproducing (abdominal males or nipples tiny females), and this majority held for each plot.
In total, 154 traps were disturbed (see Table 1 for percent disturbed by plot), with the most likely predators being Procyon lotor, Canis latrans and Martes americana. One M. Americana may have been sighted in the 1917 plot on the 2nd day of trapping. Plots 1936 and 1954 were severely disturbed on the 3rd day of trapping, with 31% and 42% of traps disturbed, respectively. Canis lantrans may have been responsible for disturbing the 1954 trap lines on the 3rd day.
In order to make comparisons across plots, we adjusted the number of individuals captured according to the following formula, which puts all of the numbers in terms of 121 traps and accounts for the effect of predator disturbance:
Spearmann-Rank Correlations indicated a relationship between CWD and reproductive status of P. leucopus. The amount of CWD >3cm in each plot was significantly negatively correlated with the percent of abdominal males in a plot (Rs=-0.9, P=0.037) and was also somewhat positively correlated with the percent of scrotal males (Rs=0.7, P=0.188). There may also be a slight correlation between CWD and the reproductive status of female mice, with non-reproductive individuals in the plots with less CWD (percent nipples tiny: Rs=-0.6, P=0.285; percent nipples enlarged: Rs=0.6, P=0.285).
The burn chronosequence exhibited a progressive change in habitat, with the number of years since burning being highly correlated with the canopy and subcanopy composition of the forest community. The percent of P. grandidentata in a plot decreased with age while Pinus spp. and Q. rubra increased in abundance with time since burning. Because we only captured 3 different species (P. leucopus, T. striatus, B. brevicauda), we were not able to conduct a rigorous investigation of changes in species diversity. However, we did observe significant differences between plots in the abundance, age structure and reproductive condition of P. leucopus. In general, there were more subadults in the intermediate-age plots, more adults in the oldest plot and more juveniles in the most recently burned plot than expected. Overall, there was a higher percentage of reproductive females in the 1917 plot, a higher percentage of non-reproducing P. leucopus in the intermediate plots and no deviation from the expected values for the youngest plot.
The most coarse woody debris and the highest number of reproductive individuals were found in the 1917 and 1998 plots. This pattern is supported by the significant correlation of high levels of CWD with the presence of scrotal males. Further research should investigate the extent to which P. leucopus utilize CWD for nest-sites, runways, foraging, etc. in the burn plots. Casual observation indicated that several burrows were located near CWD and that large numbers of insects, a preferred food for P. leucopus (Wolff et al. 1985), were present beneath the debris in the 1998 plot .
We were not able to confirm the existence of a source-sink scenario occurring in the intermediately aged plots. However, the high percentage of subadults (the age for emigration) paired with the low overall P. leucopus abundance and dearth of high quality food sources (few oaks, pines and CWD), makes this a plausible explanation for some of the variation between plots. However, caution must be taken when determining what sort of habitat is acceptable for P. leucopus since they are capable of living at high densities across a wide-variety of habitats (Lackey 1978), and they are flexible in their food preferences (Drickamer 1976). Additional research should incorporate a ground cover survey in order to account for the presence and quality of fruiting shrubs, since these could comprise a major part of the diet of P. leucopus during certain parts of the year.
The 1998 plot may have been a more suitable habitat than originally expected (supporting high numbers of adults) due to the large amount of coarse woody debris, which has the potential to provide food/foraging habitat, thermal regulation and shelter. Additionally, the presence of P. grandidentata may have accelerated the recovery of the 1998 plot because aspen can occupy a site quickly after fire (through root-suckering) and aspen groves create more moderate temperature and moisture conditions (Burt Barnes, personal communication).
We did not observe much movement between plots. When we did capture individuals, they were males that had traveled from the intermediate plots to the 1917 plot, matching the literature findings that males often travel longer distances (Hirth 1959).
One important area requiring further investigation is the influence of post-fire succession on the suitability of habitat for the predators of small mammals. For example, martens are often found in the old growth stage (76 years+), but rarely in other habitats (Fisher and Wilkinson 2005). The 1998 plot could have supported higher numbers of reproducing individuals and juveniles due to reduced levels of predation as compared to the 1917 plot. Overall, very little is known about the effects of fire on carnivores (Fisher and Wilkinson 2005), but the prevalence of disturbance in our trap lines indicates that predators are an active component of the burn plots. Different rates of predation could have an important impact on P. leucopus demography across plots.

Myotis lucifugus and Myotis septentrionalis are two Vespertilionid bats that are sympatric over much of their ranges. Both occur throughout Michigan, and both are insectivorous. Morphologically these two species are very similar. However, M. septentrionalis tends to have longer ears and tragi. The tragus is more than half the length of the ear and comes to a narrow point (Kurta 1995). In M. lucifugus, the tragus is less than half the length of the ear and is rounded (Barclay & Fenton 1980). These species also differ in the frequency of their echolocation calls. The calls of M. septentrionalis are of shorter duration, higher average frequency, and cover a broader range of frequencies than those of M. lucifugus (Faure et al. 1993).
This difference in vocalization suggests that these two species have different foraging strategies. Myotis lucifugus is traditionally labeled as an aerial hawker that feeds primarily on aerial insects (Ratcliffe & Dawson 2003). The short, high frequency, broadband calls of M. septentrionalis are characteristic of gleaners (Schnitzler & Kalko 2001). A shorter call prevents overlap between the call and the echo at short distances, while higher average frequency and broader frequency range provide higher resolution of small objects.
Data has been presented demonstrating that both species can both glean and hawk prey, although M. septentrionalis tends to be more specialized for gleaning (Ratcliffe & Dawson 2003). Given that both M. lucifugus and M. septentrionalis exhibit behavioral flexibility in foraging technique, and considering that they are sympatric throughout much of their ranges, it is likely that these two species segregate spatially or temporally in a way that reduces interspecific competition.
To test whether such segregation exists, we chose to study the relative abundances of the two species in three habitats: wooded, river, and lakeside. Of the three, lakeside sites are the most open, followed by the river sites and then the wooded sites. If the two species are segregating spatially, they should be found in different proportions and different relative abundances in the three habitats. Aerial insects are more abundant in open habitats. Thus, we expected to see a higher relative abundance of M. lucifugus at the lakeside sites where there were more aerial insects to hawk. Additionally, given that the calls of M. septentrionalis are more specialized for gleaning, we expected to see a higher relative abundance of this species at the wooded sites where there were more stationary insects to glean. At the river sites we expected to see roughly equal relative abundances for both species.
We then monitored how the relative abundance of each species changes throughout the night to determine if the bats exhibited temporal avoidance and foraged at different times. We also looked at whether or not there was a correlation between the relative abundance of each species and the weather conditions (temperature and rain). Relative abundance was measured by counting the number of call sequences recorded at each site and identifying which species each belonged to.
Nine locations in the vicinity of the University of Michigan Biological Station (Pellston, Michigan) were chosen: three lakeside habitats (L1, L2, L3), three river habitats (R1, R2, R3), and three wooded habitats (W1, W2, W3).
All of the lakeside sites were on Douglas Lake and within walking distance of Biological Station facilities. Site L1 (45º33.65'N, 84º40.61'W) was located on the western edge of Biological Station facilities, about one meter away from the edge of the lake. Sites L2 (45º33.74'N, 84º40.08'W) and L3 (45º33.89'N, 84º39.88'W) were located on the eastern shore of Douglas Lake. Site L2 was 1 meter above the water surface and 4.5 meters away, and L3 was 1.8 meters above the water surface and 5 meters away. Site L3 was north of L2.
The study was conducted for eight nights from June 25, 2004 through July 4, 2004. There was no observation on the nights of June 27 and July 3. The study ran from 9:00 pm until 5:30 am on each night of observation.
An Anabat II detector connected to a voice activated tape recorder was left at two sites per night. The first site was visited on the hour and the second was visited on the half hour to allow for travel between sites.
Temperature was measured with a mercury thermometer in degrees Fahrenheit. Wind speed was measured with an anemometer in meters per second. Also recorded were rainfall (no rain, light rain, or heavy rain), light (visible moon or no moon), and visibility (fog or no fog).
The data on each tape were recorded onto a computer using the program Anabat 5. The calls were analyzed using Analyze 2.1, which provided us with maximum frequency, average frequency, minimum frequency, curvature, duration, end slope, and start slope of each pulse in a call. Within each call, all of the pulses with a modal quality of 0.9 or greater were analyzed. If over half of the pulses had an average frequency greater than 50 KHz, the call was attributed to M. septentrionalis. If over half of the pulses had an average frequency less than 45 KHz, the call was attributed to M. lucifugus. If over half of the end slopes of the pulses were less than -10, the call was attributed to M. septentrionalis.
Out of a total of 334 call sequences recorded, 289 were identifiable using the above characteristics.  The remaining 45 were intermediate or contained conflicting pulse values. These calls were subjected to a discriminant function analysis, which was based on 17 known M. septentrionalis and 18 known M. lucifugus calls provided by Mr. Matt Wund, University of Michigan Museum of Zoology. This procedure classified 11 of the 45 unknown calls as either M. septentrionalis or M. lucifugus with a posterior probability of 0.95 or greater. These 11 were added to the identified calls, producing a total of 300 identified call sequences. Of these, 79 were identified as M. lucifugus and 221 were identified as M. septentrionalis.
For both M. lucifugus (P = 0.738, Mann-Whitney, U = 1535) and M. septentrionalis (P = 0.468, Mann-Whitney, U = 1476), the number of calls was not related to whether it was raining at the time the calls were recorded. Additionally, the relative abundance of neither species was correlated with temperature (P > 0.05, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, D = 0.105161).
The absence of M. septentrionalis at lakeside sites and its abundance at wooded sites confirms that this species is specialized for gleaning and prefers to forage in more enclosed habitats, as indicated by its high frequency, broadband calls. This preference serves to separate the niches of the two species and reduce competition between them.
While M. septentrionalis prefers to forage in wooded sites, M. lucifugus showed less of a preference. The roughly equal numbers of M. lucifugus at lakeside (34) and wooded (33) sites suggest that this species is a generalist and will both hawk and glean prey.
However, 70% of all calls (211 of 300) were recorded at wooded habitats. The 33 M. lucifugus calls at the wooded sites made up only 16% of the total number of calls recorded at wooded sites. At the lakeside sites, the 34 M. lucifugus calls makes up 81% of the total number of calls recorded.
Thus, the relative abundance of M. lucifugus was the highest at the lakeside sites. The unequal proportions of M. lucifugus at lakeside (.81) and wooded (.16) sites further confirms that M. septentrionalis prefers wooded sites over lakeside sites. However, it cannot be concluded from these two pieces of data that M. lucifugus prefers lakeside sites, because M. lucifugus numbers at lakeside sites were equal to those at wooded sites.
Both species showed the most activity during the early hours of the night. However, while M. lucifugus becomes active again at about 1:00 am, M. septentrionalis numbers steadily decline and drop off at around that time. This trend may be related to being a gleaner. Because a gleaner must snatch insects off of stationary objects, it would be helpful for them to supplement their echolocation with sight. Further, because sight depends on the availability of light, using sight would be more effective during the earlier hours of the evening.
Rainfall and temperature data, neither of which was significant, nonetheless could have had an influence on the temporal data. Rainfall and temperature were recorded once an hour. Thus, calls recorded during an hour in which rainfall was observed were not necessarily recorded in the rain.
Another problem with the study arose from limitations of the Anabat II detector. The detector recorded only the number of calls, not the number of bats present. It is possible that multiple passes were made by a single bat. For each species, if the number of calls was evenly distributed amongst the number of bats present, then the number of calls recorded is indicative of the relative abundance of that species, and this problem should not influence our results. However, if most of the calls recorded were made by one or a few bats, then the number of calls was not evenly distributed, and this could have affected our results.
It would also be helpful to see if the spatial and temporal segregation we observed exists in areas where the two species are allopatric. If this is the case, then we can conclude that the segregation we observed is due to intrinsic differences between the two and that competition does not influence habitat preference. If, however, either of the species expands its foraging habitats (if either species shows no preference for any of the habitats), then the segregation we observed was due to competition.

It is widely assumed that cellular functions are organized in a highly hierarchical and modular mannar (Hartwell, Hopfield et al. 1999). Each module is a discrete object composed of a group of tightly linked components and performs an independent task, seperable from the function of other modules (Hartwell, Hopfield et al. 1999; Ravasz, Somera et al. 2002). With the advent of genome scale data, many efforts have been devoted into identifying modular structures and their biological significance (Barabasi and Oltvai 2004). To thoroughly study the modular structure(Ravasz, Somera et al. 2002; Rives and Galliski 2003; Yook, Oltvai et al. 2004) of large scale networks require effective and automatic method that can separate modules. Clustering could be one of the methods to discover module structure in networks using topological structure (Ravasz, Somera et al. 2002; Giot 2003; Yook, Oltvai et al. 2004). And some studies combined clustering with functional genomics data also gave good result (Stiart, Segal et al. 2003; Tornow and Mewes 2003). By using RNA expression profile data, Han etc. (Han, Bertin et al. 2004) divided the hubs into data hub and party hub and showed modularity organization in yeast protein-protein interaction networks. Fraser (Fraser 2005) studied the evolutionary conservation of data hubs and party hubs and suggested the occurring of modules through exon shuffling.
However, the module separation by clustering usually gives ambiguity result (Barabasi and Oltvai 2004), part of which is because of the network's hierarchical structure. But lack of objective judgment could be another reason. Newman (Newman and Girvan 2004) proposed a method to measure the modularity of the separated modular structure and devised a greedy method to separate module according to edge betweenness (Newman 2004). Based on the modularity definition, many other algorithms were invented to get the global maximized modularity because greedy methods could be easily trapped in local maximization (Duch and Arenas 2005; Guimera and Amaral 2005; Massen and Doye 2005). Heuristic algorithms often give better result, especially for the networks with relatively low hierarchical structure. Using stimulated annealing to maximizing the network's modularity, Guimera and Amaral (Guimera and Amaral 2005) was able to identify the functional organization of metabolic networks. According to the topological properties, functional roles were determined for each node and they showed the evolutionary conservation among different roles of nodes. Nevertheless, their result that intra-module hubs are less conserved than the intermodule nodes, which contradicts with Fraser's (Fraser 2005) result for protein networks that intramodule hubs are more conserved.
In this paper, modules are separated solely based on the topology of protein networks. The biological significance of modular structures is accessed by functional and evolutionary data. The modular structures show highly evolutionary conservation when comparing the orthologous proteins in yeast and fly modules.
The modules of protein-protein interaction networks of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiare and fly Drosophila melanogaster was identified using simulation annealing algorithm. For the protein networks, the largest component contains 3862 nodes (about 94% out of 4216 nodes for the entire network) forming 7208 edges for yeast and 6279 nodes (95% of all) forming 10094 edges. The overall modularity is 0.666 for yeast and 0.685 for fly suggestting a high modular organization of the network (table 1).
To correlate the functional properties and topological modules, functional classification established by MIPS was used in which each protein is assigned a function category according to the enzyme function. I filtered the data that only functional categories containing more than 10 proteins were used, and totally there are 17 functional categories including unclassified proteins.
For each module, the sum of genes in each functional category was calculated. To get the expected number, random module separation ran for 1000 times, and the average was used as the mathematical expectation. I used
A discrete module that performs a certain function is much likely located in the same cellular location. Based on this idea, global protein localization data in budding yeast is used to check the biased distribution of each module. The same as functional category, each location of proteins in modules is counted and simulation was used to calculate the expected distribution.
Nonsynonymous changes in sequences will result in protein sequences change, and could be used to measure the distance or evolutionary conservation of proteins. And a low evolutionary rate usually indicates strong functional constraint. Nonsynonymous substitutions per site (dN) was calculated for all the genes with ortholog in S. bayanus a closely related species. The Spearman's rank correlation was used to evaluate the evolutionary conservation of topological structure (table 1).
The result shows only dN and within-module degree is very significantly and negatively correlated which indicate that within-module hubs are more conserved. And this result is robust because there is no significant correlation between between-module degree and dN which would not confound the correlation between within-module degree.
Another way to measure the evolutionary conservation is the phylogenetic conservation across species. If the gene subjects high functional constraints, it is very unlikely to be lost during the
evolution. So, by counting the gene loss events on a phylogenetic tree also reflects the evolutionary conservation for the gene. I used all S. cerevisiea gene to blast against the other 9 species and identified a number of gene loss events on each brach. And in the following work I will analyze the distribution and correlation with the network topological properties.
Because of the functional correspondence to module, the importance of each module may be varied depending on the functional importance. To access the differences among modules, I examined the distribution of essential genes which would cause death if knocked out. If one module has more essential genes, it tends to be more important in terms of function. While if there is no functional differences among modules, essential genes should be randomly distributed in each module.
Although the interactions between proteins are less conserved across distant species (Gandhi, Zhong et al. 2006), they may show some conservation at modular structure level in which orthologous genes across species share the same module. To test this hypothesis, I used the same method to separate modules for D. drosophila protein-protein interaction network. And the homologous genes are identified using reciprocal blast best hits. If the homologous genes are grouped into the same module, the hierarchical modular structure will be conserved. The result shows this (figure 4). The same as function and location, conservation profile is used to show the relationship. And the
The hierarchical structure of the protein networks could correspond to the functional category, which is consistent with previous studies(Tornow and Mewes 2003; Yook, Oltvai et al. 2004). However, my result does not suggest a direct one-to-one or one-to-multiple correspondence between functional categories and modules. Noise in the data maybe one reason; another reason could be the module structure may not reflect the enzyme based functional classification. The direct evidence that pairs of proteins within the same module tend to be in the same protein complex structure indicate that protein complex is better correspondence to the module structure (Spirin and Mirny 2003).
Because highly pleiotropic genes tend to have multiple functions and they could be the nodes link to many other modules, they are usually thought to be more conserved (Fraser 2005). Participation coefficient measures how the between-module links distributed (Guimera and Amaral 2005; Guimera and Amaral 2005). This result suggest that either participation coefficient is not corresponded to pleiotropy or there is no correlation between pleiotropy and evolutionary conservation.
The result of no significant correlation between dN and betweenness centrality is somehow surprising. Because Hahn and Kern's (Hahn and Kern 2004) study suggests a significant correlation between betweenness centrality and gene essentiality in three eukaryotic protein networks, although the correlation is very week.
Finally, although the differences among modules are statistically significant, only a few of them show a strong biased distribution. And querying these modules to functional category distribution gives no significant biased distribution.
In fact, protein-protein interaction data set is highly noisy (Barabasi and Oltvai 2004). This is partly come from the random errors in large scale experiments. But they may also come from the method of yeast two hybrids to detect interacting protein pairs. A number of studies (Aloy and Russell 2002; Han, Dupuy et al. 2005) suggested artifacts in protein interaction networks and sampling may also result in biased data set. This result in the genome scale analysis becomes very hard because noise reduces the signals significantly.
Protein-protein interaction networks data set for Saccharomyces cerevisiea was downloaded from MIPS (http://mips.gsf.de/). Only the nodes in the largest component of the network were used to separate module by simulated annealing algorithm.
Functional annotation for S. cerevisiea genes were also downloaded from MIPS and protein complex data came from IntAct database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact). I compared the distribution of gene in each module and the functional category for each gene to evaluate the functional correspondence of module structure. Protein complex data was another way to measure the biological meaning of network module. I also calculated the betweenness centrality for each node using Pejak.
The evolutionary rate dN for S. cerevisiea genes were calculated against orthologous genes of S. bayanus. The loss of genes on other braches of yeast was also used to evaluate the phylogenetic conservation. Specificly, I use BLAST against the whole genome sequences of other 9 species, S. paradoxus, S. mikatea, S. bayanus, C. glabrata, K. waltii, K. lactis, D. hansenii, Y. lipolytice, N. crassa and S. pombe using 0.1 as criteria to detect gene loss. Parsomony method was used to calculate gene loss events on each brach with S. pombe as the outgroup. I compared the correlation among within module-degree, between-module degree, participation coefficient, betweenness centrality, dN and gene loss events to get evolutionary conservation for the roles of nodes.
Finally, the protein-protein interaction data for Drosophila melanogaster (downloaded from flybase (http://flybase.net)) was used to detect the evolutionary conservation of hierarchical modular structure between yeast and fly.

Since the first vertebrates invaded the terrestrial realm around 350 million years ago (Clack 2002a, 2002b; Long and Gordon 2004), several subsequent groups of tetrapods have become readapted for an aquatic lifestyle (Mazin and de Buffrénil 2001). Among mammals, the spectrum of secondarily aquatic forms ranges from fully aquatic cetaceans and sirenians to semiaquatic taxa that spend much of their time on land but forage in the water (Gingerich 2003). One of the most speciose groups of secondarily aquatic mammals today, composed of about 36 extant species, is the Pinnipedia (Berta and Adam 2001; Berta et al. 2006). Pinnipeds are highly derived, mostly aquatic mammals within the Order Carnivora and are divided into three modern families: Odobenidae (walruses), Otariidae (sea lions and fur seals), and Phocidae (true or earless seals) (Berta et al. 2006). Based on morphological and paleontological evidence, pinnipeds were traditionally thought to have a diphyletic origin (McLaren 1960; Tedford 1976). This view maintained that the odobenids and otariids were derived from ursid (bears) ancestry and that phocids had a separate origin from somewhere within the mustelid (weasels, otters, etc.) lineage. Wyss (1987) reassessed the morphological evidence and suggested a common origin for all pinnipeds. A number of morphological (Wyss 1988; Berta et al. 1989; Wyss 1989; Wyss and Flynn 1993; Berta and Wyss 1994) and molecular studies (Sarich 1969; Árnason and Widegren 1986; Vrana et al. 1994; Árnason et al. 1995; Lento et al. 1995; Flynn and Nedbal 1998; Davis et al. 2004; Árnason et al. 2006) have since given strong support for pinniped monophyly, but the arctoid group from which pinnipeds arose has not yet been agreed upon, with studies suggesting ursid (Wyss and Flynn 1993; Berta and Wyss 1994; Vrana et al. 1994; Lento et al. 1995), mustelid (Árnason and Widegren 1986; Flynn and Nedbal 1998), or general arctoid ancestry (Davis et al. 2004; Árnason et al. 2006).
One way in which the pinniped groups significantly differ from each other is how they swim. Otariids swim using a form of locomotion called pectoral oscillation, in which the highly modified fore-flippers are the sole source of thrust while the hind limbs and axial skeleton play no apparent role (English 1976; Feldkamp 1987a, 1987b). Conversely, phocids and odobenids swim using primarily pelvic oscillation, in which the cranial end of the body is held rigid while the hind limbs perform a side-to-side "sculling" motion to generate forward thrust (Tarasoff et al. 1972; Gordon 1981). Both modes of swimming are highly derived and require very specialized morphologies in order to perform them (Fish 1996; Berta and Adam 2001). During the evolutionary transition from land to sea in pinnipeds, taxa intermediate between the fully terrestrial ancestors and the mostly aquatic descendents would have lacked some of these skeletal adaptations and would have swum in a manner different from modern forms. Since locomotion is central to an animal's ability to forage, evade predators, disperse, and migrate (Fish 1992), understanding how these highly derived modes of locomotion evolved from less efficient modes can inform us about the ecologies and lifestyles of intermediate species and help us understand how the land-to-sea transition progressed.
Models have been proposed to explain how highly derived modes of swimming could have evolved through semiaquatic taxa performing a series of increasingly efficient swimming styles (Fish 1996, 2000, 2001), but these studies have been based primarily on studies of swimming in living aquatic and semiaquatic mammals. Few studies have assessed the evolution of swimming mode in secondarily aquatic taxa using fossil evidence. Berta and Adam (2001) used the morphologies of extant pinnipeds to interpret the locomotor capabilities of extinct forms and placed these swimming styles onto a phylogeny to assess how forelimb- and hind limb- dominated swimming evolved within pinnipeds. Their results suggested: (1) that forelimb-dominated swimming was ancestral for the group, (2) that hind limb-dominated swimming arose once at the base of the Phocomorpha (the sister group to the Otariidae), and (3) that there was one reversal back to forelimb swimming in the Dusignathinae (Figure 1). However, the interpretations of locomotor mode in some of the fossil taxa in this study (mainly Enaliarctos and the Desmatophocidae) are not as straightforward as these authors presented them to be, and their potential locomotor capabilities could stand to be reassessed.
The most primitive known group of pinnipedimorphs is the Enaliarctinae (Barnes 1989, 1990; Berta 1991; Barnes 1992). Enaliarctos mealsi, from the late Oligocene of California, is known on the basis of a virtually complete skeleton (Figure 2A-B), and when it was initially described, it was thought to swim using a combination of fore flippers, hind flippers, and undulation of the axial skeleton to generate thrust (Berta et al. 1989; Berta and Ray 1990). However, Berta and Adam (2001) asserted that Enaliarctos
Likewise, there has been disagreement as to how the desmatophocid Allodesmus kernensis swam (Figure 2C). This species is a member of the Desmatophocidae, a group which was once considered to be a subfamily of Otariidae (Mitchell 1966; Barnes 1972; Mitchell 1975; Barnes 1989) but is now thought to be the sister group of the Phocidae (Berta 1994; Berta and Wyss 1994; Deméré and Berta 2002). The initial descriptions of Allodesmus postulated it used solely its forelimbs in aquatic locomotion, much as modern otariids do (Mitchell 1966; Barnes 1972). However, Giffin (1992) demonstrated that the anatomy of the neural canal in this species suggests that its torso, fore-, and hind limbs all possessed significant innervation. This morphology was found to be most similar to odobenids, and Giffin called into question the previous interpretations of forelimb-dominated swimming. Berta and Adam (2001) noted that Allodesmus has features indicative of both forelimb and hind limb swimming, but they coded it as being a hind limb swimmer in their locomotor analysis, an interpretation that has persisted in recent references (e.g. Berta et al. 2006).
For at least these two species, there is some question as to whether they swam using primarily forelimb-or hind limb-dominated locomotion, and given their phylogenetic positions in relation to other pinnipedimorph taxa, understanding the evolution of locomotion within the entire group is contingent on having accurate inferences about their swimming mode. Given their relatively complete skeletons, locomotor interpretations for Enaliarctos and Allodesmus can tested by including them in a principal components analysis (PCA) on skeletal proportions in extant semiaquatic mammals like that performed by Gingerich (2003). This method has been used to interpret locomotor mode in fossil whales (Gingerich 2003), desmostylians (Gingerich 2005), and pantolestids (Rose and von Koenigswald 2005), and by finding which modern mammals Enaliarctos and Allodesmus are most similar to in overall skeletal proportions, we will be able to make well-informed inferences about their swimming modes. These results can then be looked at in a phylogenetic context, as was done by Berta and Adam (2001), in order to assess how locomotor evolution occurred in pinnipeds.
Of the fourteen skeletal measurements included in the PCA performed by Gingerich (2003), thirteen of the measurements for Enaliarctos were obtained from Berta and Ray (1990) (Table 1). The missing measurement, the length of pedal phalanx III-2, was estimated by scaling it down from the length of metatarsal III in the same proportion as pedal phalanx II-2 is scaled down in length from metatarsal II. A PCA was carried out on 14 skeletal measurements for 61 extant semiaquatic taxa following the methods described in Gingerich (2003). These 61 taxa included the 50 specimens used by Gingerich (2003), as well as 11 additional pinnipeds and lutrine mustelids to increase the representation of these diverse groups in the data set (Table 1). Eigenvector coefficients for each of most informative principal component axes were multiplied by the normalized, natural log-transformed measurements and summed across all 14 measurements to generate scores for each species for each principal component. Enaliarctos was not included in the PCA itself, but was added as a supplemental taxon, following the treatment of fossil taxa in previous analyses (Gingerich 2003, 2005; Rose and von Koenigswald 2005), and was plotted in the same space as the modern taxa using the eigenvector coefficients generated by the PCA to calculate its PC scores. For Allodesmus, no pedal phalanges are known, so an additional PCA was carried out using only 12 of the 14 measurements. Measurements for the thorax, lumbus, humerus, radius, femur, and tibia of Allodesmus were obtained from tables in Mitchell (1966), while the remaining measurements were estimated from photographic plates therein (Table 1). Like Enaliarctos, Allodesmus was not included in the PCA itself, but its PC scores were calculated using the eigenvector coefficients resulting from the analysis. The locomotor modes inferred for these two taxa based on the PCAs were then placed onto a phylogeny of pinnipeds to assess when different swimming styles appeared within the history of the group, thus giving us an overall picture of how this important behavior may have been evolving during this land-to-sea transition.
The first PCA performed in this study included 14 skeletal measurements for 61 extant semiaquatic mammals. The eigenvalues and eigenvector coefficients (loadings) for each principal component are listed in Table 2, with the eigenvector coefficients also being shown graphically in Figures 3-4. The variation in this data set was reduced to three informative axes. PC-I accounted for 93.1% of the total variance in measurements, and all of the eigenvector coefficients are positive and of a similar magnitude. This is very similar to Gingerich's (2003) results, and this axis can best be understood as representing overall size, with smaller individuals possessing more negative PC-I scores and larger individuals possessing more positive PC-I scores. PC-II accounted for 4.2% of the total variance, and the eigenvector coefficients indicate that the strongest contrast on PC-II is between individuals with long manual and pedal phalanges and individuals with a long femur and ilium, just as in Gingerich's (2003) analysis. This axis can thus be interpreted as separating more terrestrial species on the positive end of the axis from more aquatic species on the negative end. PC-III accounted for 0.8% of the total variance, and the eigenvector coefficients indicate that the strongest contrast is between taxa with a long lumbus, a long third metatarsal, and long pedal phalanges and taxa with a long third metacarpal and long manual phalanges. Again, this follows Gingerich's (2003) results, so PC-III can be interpreted as separating hind limb-dominated swimmers with more negative PC-III scores from forelimb-dominated swimmers with more positive PC-III scores. PC scores for each taxon for the first three principal components are listed in Table 4 and shown graphically in Figures 3-4. When the PC scores for Enaliarctos are plotted in the same space as the modern taxa, it plots right with other pinnipeds on the size axis and appears to be less aquatic than the majority of the modern otariids and phocids but more aquatic than Odobenus on the terrestrial/aquatic axis. On the locomotion axis, Enaliarctos actually plots within the space occupied by the Phocidae, suggesting that Enaliarctos was primarily a hind limb-dominated swimmer and calling into question the recent interpretations that this species swam primarily using its forelimbs to generate propulsion.
The second PCA included only 12 skeletal measurements for the 61 extant semiaquatic mammals. The eigenvalues and eigenvector coefficients (loadings) for each principal component are listed in Table 3, with the eigenvector coefficients also being shown graphically in Figures 5-6. The variation in the data was again reduced to three informative axes. PC-I accounted for 93.8% of the total variance in the dataset, and since the eigenvector coefficients were all positive and of a similar magnitude, this axis can again be interpreted as representing size. PC-II accounted for 3.6% of the total variance, and compared with the eigenvector coefficients from the first PCA, the coefficients for each measurement in this case fell in relatively the same locations as in the previous analysis, simply with loadings for pedal phalanges being absent. The largest contrast on PC-II is thus between individuals with long manual phalanges and individuals with a long femur and ilium. It appears safe to assume that this axis can again be interpreted as separating more terrestrial taxa on the positive end from more aquatic taxa on the negative end. PC-III accounted for 0.9% of the total variance, and while the more intermediate eigenvector coefficients shifted around slightly, the most extreme values are the same as in the first PCA. The largest contrast on PC-III in this second case is between individuals with a long lumbus, long third metatarsal, and long tibia and individuals with a long third metacarpal and long manual phalanges. This axis can again be interpreted as separating hind limb-dominated swimmers with more negative PC-III scores from forelimb-dominated swimmers with more positive PC-III scores. PC scores for each taxon for the first three principal components are listed in Table 4 and shown graphically in Figures 5-6. When PC scores are calculated for Allodesmus and plotted in the same space as the scores of the extant species, it plots among the larger pinnipeds but appears less aquatic than all pinnipeds except for Odobenus. On the locomotion axis, Allodesmus plots outside of both the Phocidae and the Otariidae, but is much closer to the Otariidae on the forelimb-dominated side of the axis. This implies that Allodesmus has skeletal proportions similar to pectoral oscillators and swam primarily using its forelimbs, which is counter to the most recent interpretations of locomotion in this species.
These new locomotor interpretations were then analyzed in a phylogenetic context following the approach of Berta and Adam (2001) (Figure 7). The topology of the tree follows the results of Berta and Wyss (1994) and Deméré (1994), and the inferred locomotor modes of taxa not included in the PCA follow the interpretations of Berta and Adam (2001). If Enaliarctos is indeed a hind limb-dominated swimmer and Allodesmus a forelimb-dominated swimmer as the PCA results suggest, then it appears that hind limb-dominated swimming had to have arisen at least two times independently. If we posit that hind limb swimming arose once at the base of the Phocomorpha ([Desmatophocidae + Phocidae] + Odobenidae) and once in the Enaliarctinae lineage, then we also must posit an additional reversal to forelimb swimming in the Desmatophocidae. Another possibility would be to propose that hind limb swimming arose independently within the Phocidae and the Odobenidae, which would decrease the number of reversals to forelimb swimming (only once within the Dusignathinae), but would increase the number of independent acquisitions of hind limb-dominated swimming to three. The main point is that if these locomotor interpretations are correct for Enaliarctos and Allodesmus, then the evolution of swimming in pinnipeds involves a number of additional locomotor transitions than what Berta and Adam's (2001) initial analysis proposed.
Like many other tetrapod groups, ancestral pinnipeds embarked on a journey beginning on land and eventually finishing in the sea. Looking at modern secondarily-aquatic vertebrates and their supposed ancestral groups, it is clear that the starting and ending points for each of these land-to-sea transitions are unique, and the pathway that each of these lineages took to readapt to an aquatic environment was novel as well (Gingerich 2005). One aspect of reconstructing and understanding these transitions is to elucidate the evolution of locomotor modes, which informs us about the way in which an organism could interact with other species in its environment.
Previous attempts to analyze the evolution of locomotion in pinnipeds have relied on the presence or absence of osteological characters associated with each swimming mode (Berta and Adam 2001). This technique may work well for taxa close to the modern groups of pinnipeds, but it presents difficulties when interpreting locomotor capabilities in taxa that are less closely-related to the modern clades. Both Enaliarctos mealsi (Berta et al. 1989; Berta and Ray 1990) and Allodesmus kernensis (Giffin 1992) had been described as possessing features consistent with using forelimbs, hind limbs, and their axial skeleton to generate thrust during aquatic locomotion, but were shoehorned into either forelimb-or hind limb-dominated swimming based on possession of a handful of characters (Berta and Adam 2001; Berta et al. 2006). Their relatively complete skeletons allow their overall skeletal proportions to be looked at in comparison with modern semiaquatic taxa, and by elucidating which modern taxa they are most similar to proportionally, we have a way to quantitatively assess locomotor interpretations in these fossil taxa.
The placement of Enaliarctos on the size axis (PC-I) indicated that it was an average-sized species when compared with modern pinnipeds, and it appeared to be less aquatic than most of the modern pinnipeds on the axis for PC-II. It plotted among the phocids on the locomotion axis (PC-III), suggesting that it swam using a hind limb-dominated mode of locomotion. This interpretation is in contrast to recent suggestions that it was more specialized for forelimb swimming (Berta and Adam 2001; Berta et al. 2006), but given that its hind limbs are relatively larger than its forelimbs (Berta and Ray 1990), hind limb-dominated swimming seems like a more plausible interpretation. Allodesmus appeared to be of a similar size to some of the larger modern pinnipeds, but like Enaliarctos, its PC-II score indicated that it was less aquatically-adapted than most modern pinnipeds. Its PC-III score placed it closest to modern otariids, which suggests that it might have used predominantly forelimb swimming. This, again, is in contrast to the most recent interpretations (Berta and Adam 2001; Berta et al. 2006), but it supports the notions put forth by earlier authors that this animal was similar to modern otariids in habit (Mitchell 1966; Barnes 1972; Mitchell 1975).
Placing these new interpretations onto a phylogeny to assess the evolution of swimming mode in pinnipeds complicates the picture depicted by Berta and Adam (2001), as it calls for several additional transitions in locomotor mode than they proposed. But subscribing to this overall picture of locomotor evolution is contingent upon the inferred phylogenetic relationships being correct. While pinnipeds are generally agreed to be a monophyletic group derived from arctoid carnivores, the relationships among members within the group are still contentious. Traditionally, otariids and odobenids were allied within the Otarioidea (McLaren 1960; Barnes 1972; Mitchell 1975; Tedford 1976; Barnes 1989), but many recent analyses have placed the odobenids as the sister group to the Phocoidea (Desmatophocidae + Phocidae), forming the Phocomorpha (Wyss 1987; Berta et al. 1989; Wyss 1989; Berta and Ray 1990; Berta 1991; Berta and Wyss 1994; Deméré and Berta 2002; Berta et al. 2006). Molecular analyses have consistently suggested that odobenids are more closely related to otariids (Sarich 1969; Árnason et al. 1995; Lento et al. 1995; Flynn and Nedbal 1998; Davis et al. 2004; Flynn and Wesley-Hunt 2005; Árnason et al. 2006), but some authors argue that these results are due to long-branch attraction since the odobenid lineage appears to have split off early in the history of the group (Berta and Adam 2001; Berta et al. 2006). Using inferred locomotor mode like a character on a phylogenetic tree to interpret the evolution of locomotion is obviously contingent on the topology of that tree, so the picture of swimming evolution derived from this strategy could change drastically if the inferred relationships among the groups were to change. Thus, the interpretations of locomotor evolution across all pinniped lineages should be viewed with caution in light of the equivocal relationships among the different groups.
We should also be careful not to think that any animal must use exclusively one swimming mode. Modern otters use a variety of different swimming modes depending on what they are doing and where they are in the water (Fish 1994), and even the modern walrus, while using primarily pelvic oscillation, is known to use pectoral paddling as well when swimming at slow speeds (Gordon 1981). Given that Enaliarctos (Berta et al. 1989; Berta and Ray 1990) and Allodesmus (Giffin 1992; Berta and Adam 2001) have both been described as possessing adaptations for multiple swimming modes, we must not too quickly interpret them as using solely forelimb- or hind limb- dominated swimming, despite their placement on the locomotion axis in the PCA. The PCA simply demonstrated which modern animals were most similar in proportions to these fossil taxa, and by association, we were able to infer something about their locomotion based on that of the modern taxa with which they clustered. For Enaliarctos in particular, it is actually quite attractive to hypothesize that it may have used multiple locomotor modes given its relationship to modern pinnipeds. If it could be shown to be the common ancestor of all later pinnipedimorphs rather than the outgroup to them, it may help explain how distinctly different locomotor modes (fore- and hind limb- dominated swimming) could have evolved from a common ancestor that showed a propensity for both fore- and hind limb swimming. By incorporating stratigraphic data into these phylogenetic reconstructions, we could test ancestor-descendent hypotheses, and this may offer a more complete picture of both locomotor evolution and the evolution of these groups in general.
The PCA performed in this paper was successful in demonstrating the modern pinnipeds to which Enaliarctos mealsi and Allodesmus kernensis were most similar in skeletal proportions. Their similarity to modern phocids and otariids respectively called into question some previous hypotheses of dominant swimming mode, thus slightly complicating our view of how this critical behavior evolved within the group. Yet while these results may obscure our understanding of the evolution of this behavior, they demonstrate the importance of using multiple approaches to assess behavior in extinct taxa. Using solely osteological characters or statistical techniques gives an incomplete picture of these animals and their supposed abilities. Interpretations from statistical analyses like the PCA performed here should be used to supplement an assessment of osteological characters when inferring locomotor modes and other behaviors, as it is important to garner as much information as possible when reconstructing the lifestyles of extinct creatures.

Cichlidae is a monophyletic group of perciform fishes with a species diversity approaching 2,000 described species (Kullander 1998, Sparks 2001). The group is widely distributed on former Gondwanan fragments: South and Central America (300 spp.), Africa (1,000 spp.), Madagascar (>18spp.), India (3spp.), and the Middle East (3 spp.) (Figure 1). There has been resurgence of discussion of the historical biogeography of this group in recent years with the discovery of the oldest known cichlid fossils and new molecular evidence (Murray 2001, 2001b; Sparks 2001; Vences 2001; Kumazawa et al. 2000; see review in Chakrabarty 2003).
Recent phylogenetic work finds that each continental assemblage of cichlids forms its own monophyletic group with the exception of Madagascar (Sparks 2001; Farias et al. 1999, 2000; Streelman et al. 1998; Zardoya et al.1996, see Chakrabarty 2003 for alternatives and explanation). This has led some to propose a Cretaceous origin of Cichlidae before the break-up of Gondwana (Sparks 2001; Stiassny 1991). Dispersalists point out the minimum age of the Cichlidae based on the oldest known fossils is Eocene (45 million years ago), and use the lack of fossil cichlids before this time as evidence for recent dispersal events to explain current cichlid distributions (Murray 2001b; Lundberg 1993).
Malagasy cichlids are shown to be sister to cichlids on India in every analysis to include them (Stiassny et al. 2001; Sparks 2001; Farias et al. 1999, 2000; Streelman et al. 1998; Zardoya 1996; Cichocki 1976; Streelman & Karl 1997; Lippitsch 1995; Oliver 1984; Kullander 1998). This Malagasy-Indian relationship is the most well corroborated sister grouping of cichlids and in the dispersalist framework this relationship would mean that cichlids were capable of dispersing across the entire Indian Ocean but not across the Mozambique Channel (430 km wide at its narrowest point) to Africa.
Cichlids are primarily a strictly freshwater water group with some species able to tolerate brackish waters and a few that are considered salt tolerant (Murray 2001b). With no known cases of cichlids dispersing from one landmass to another across a salt-water divide, the marine environment should still be considered a barrier to cichlid dispersal.
There are landmasses that are not Gondwanan in origin that have cichlids, these are the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola (Figure 2). These islands have a complex geological history and there are a number of alternative hypotheses of how the fauna and flora of these islands evolved. The mechanism that allowed cichlids to invade these islands will be explored in this study.
The relationships of the Greater Antillean cichlid fauna are important because the Antilles are not geologically Gondawanan in origin, although they may have in various times of their history been connected to Gondwanan fragments. Leon Croizat's (1962) metaphor of vicariance biogeography being like reconstructing a pane of glass that has been repeatedly shattered seems particularly relevant to the Greater Antilles.
Geologically speaking, the Greater Antilles rest upon a small plate located between the much larger North America, South American and Cocos and Nazca plates. The Caribbean plate itself can be divided into a series of minor plates that have separated and merged at various times in their history (Perfit & Williams 1989). Despite their history and position on a tectonic plate, these islands are usually labeled as "oceanic." This nomenclature, like "secondary freshwater," assumes a priori that overwater dispersal is the only mechanism for organisms to populate these islands. Paulay (1994) defined oceanic islands as islands that have never been connected to a mainland continent and therefore are populated solely by dispersal. Given the aforementioned tectonic reconstructions, this definition does not fit the Greater Antilles.
Two alternative tectonic reconstructions involving a land connection between the Greater Antilles and either mainland South America or Central America will be discussed. Rosen (1975, 1985) developed a vicariance model based on Malfait and Dinkelman (1972) and Tedford's (1974) geological models of the Antilles. This view gives a Mesozoic age to the fauna of the Greater Antillean islands. This reconstruction of the Antilles, supported by many others (Pindell et al. 1988; Ross & Scotese 1988; Pindell & Barrett 1990; Pitman et al. 1993; Schuchert 1935; Dickinson & Coney 1980; but see alternatives in Hedges 1982), proposes that the Greater Antilles originated in the Pacific Ocean as a series of islands that connected North and South America as a temporary closely linked island chain circa 80 million years ago, in a position occupied by present day Central America. This arc then broke in the early Cenozoic and drifted to its current position. In Rosen's model, Jamaica, the Caymans, southwest Hispaniola, and western Cuba were connected to the southern and eastern parts of Yucatan (northern Central America) until they separated at the end of the Cretaceous, 65 million years ago.
In the alternative view proposed by Iturralde-Vinent and MacPhee (1999) based on geological evidence, a short-lived connection between the Greater Antillean Islands (Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico and possibly Jamaica) and northwest South America existed circa 32 million years ago. The authors name this Early Oligocene landbridge GAARlandia (from Greater Antilles + Aves Ridge). The consequence of this alternative is that the Greater Antillean Island chain would have had a more recent connection with South America than with Central America. The authors do not believe that there was a land connection between these islands and Central America in a way that would explain the current faunal distributions. This sets up two testable alternative hypotheses, between the relationships of Antillean cichlids with either Central or South American lineages. Non-congruence of phylogenetic pattern and sequence of divergence would favor dispersal.
There are five known cichlids from the Antilles, Cichlasoma tetracanthus, C. ramsdeni, C. haitiensis, C. vombergi and C. woodringi (see Myers 1928 and Darlington 1957 for discussion on other possible species, and distributions). The first two are restricted to Cuba, and the others to Hispaniola. The fossil C. woodringi is either Upper or Middle Miocene (23 to 5 mya) in age (Rivas 1986; Myers 1928) or Pliocene (Casciotta & Arratia 1993; Murray 2001b). It has the notoriety of being the only known freshwater fossil from the Antilles (Burgess & Franz 1989). Bussing (1985) and Rivas (pers. comm. in Burgess & Franz 1989) comment that this fossil is indistinguishable from C. haitiensis, an extant Hispaniolan species. Bussing (1985) also likens it to the Parapetenia of Central America. The generic name of these species (Cichlasoma) is sometimes referred to as Nandopsis, these names are homonyms and will be used interchangeable in this paper.
The genus Cichlasoma (sensu lato), to which all the Antillean cichlids belong, dominates the Central American cichlid fauna (75 of about 100 or more species) (Roe et al. 1997; Miller 1966; Martin & Bermingham 1998; Kullander 1983). This genus is also found throughout South America and north to Texas, but its diversity in Central America is unmatched (Bussing 1985).
To date no formal phylogenetic analysis has included the Cuban and Hispaniolan species with Central American and South American species. Rosen (1975) presented a cladogram that had a sister relationship between Central America and the Antillean cichlid fauna, however it included only the Central American and Antillean fauna. This four taxon cladogram was cited using a "personal communication" from Cichocki who did not include this analysis in any published material. Loiselle (1985) also lists Central American sister species for the Antillean cichlids, but does not discuss his phylogenetic method; it appears as if his notion is based solely on his own similarity judgment. Without a phylogenetic diagnosis, we lack a measure for selecting between alternative mechanisms for explaining this disjunct distribution. Before discussing the results of the analyses done here, it is important to discuss some important contributions on prior hypotheses of vicariance and dispersal mechanisms for these cichlids and freshwater fauna of this area; they are reviewed below.
Myers (1938, 1966; see also Darlington 1957) hypothesized that the freshwater fishes of the West
A number of authors have stated that Cuba, particularly its eastern half, was once united with Hispaniola in the early history of the Caribbean (Williams 1989; Perfit & Williams 1989). According to Pitman et al. (1993), Cuba and Hispaniola did not separate until a shearing in the late Middle Eocene. Nearly 90 % of the 71 species of Antillean freshwater fishes occur on Cuba and Hispaniola (Burgess & Franz 1989). Sixty-five of these are endemic to an island or island group (Burgess & Franz 1989). Surprisingly, Puerto Rico, the fourth largest Antillean island, separated from Hispaniola by only the narrow Mona Passage (130 km), is completely lacking in native freshwater fishes. Puerto Rico does have available habitats, as an introduced African cichlid and many other introduced species maintain populations there (Burgess & Franz 1989). Fishes dispersing from Central or South America would also probably reach Jamaica or the lower Antilles first because of their location (Fig.8). There are no cichlids on Jamaica (it does have six other native freshwater species), and there are only two native freshwater fishes on the entire Lesser Antilles. The absence of cichlids from Jamaica and particularly Puerto Rico does not bode well for the Iturralde-Vinent and MacPhee (1999) hypothesis, which posits a connection between Cuba, Hispaniola and South America, with Jamaica and Puerto Rico in-between. A complete extinction of the freshwater fish fauna would be required on Puerto Rico, after the suggested landbridge, for their hypothesis to be plausible.
Based on his vicariance model, Rosen (1975) gave a Mesozoic minimum age to the freshwater fish fauna of the Antilles including cichlids, atherinids (silversides), poeciliids and other Cyprinodontiformes, synbranchid eels and gars. Rauchenberger (1988) attempted to create a composite area cladogram from 12 other cladograms using these taxa to support Rosen's vicariance model. Most of the trees she used in her analysis are poorly resolved (the cichlid area cladogram she used is an uninformative polytomy), as she notes herself. Only the Gambusia tree (a poeciliid) provided much resolution to her composite. Unfortunately the Gambusia tree she cites (but does not show) from Fink (1971, 1971b) ignores some key elements of the original cladogram (Fink pers. comm.). Her analysis also included only one South American species, which, due to its placement at the base of the cladogram, did not affect the composite tree. It is not surprising then that she found a close relationship between the Antillean and Central American taxa (the only possibility, given her sampling).
Iturralde-Vinent and MacPhee (1999) give an age no older than the Middle Eocene for the Greater Antillean islands (including Cuba and Hispaniola), therefore claiming that that fauna must be younger than this age. On this basis they reject Rosen's (1975) Mesozoic vicariance hypothesis. Although they agree that these island masses may be as old as the Jurassic, they believe that subduction into tectonic nappes, subsidence into the water, thrusting, folding, volcanic activity and K/T bolide impact-related activity make comparisons of present day (or at least post-Eocene) Antillean islands and their Mesozoic precursors meaningless.
There are many methods that have been proposed for selecting between biogeographic hypotheses (see Crisci 2001). I adopt a cladistic biogeographic approach sensu Rosen (1978) and Nelson & Platnick (1981). This method was selected over others because it uses area cladograms that can be created from the published phylogenies reviewed here. This method was also selected over others because it is the only one that utilizes the principle of parsimony, which by minimizing assumptions finds the most efficient explanation of the evidence (Sober 1988).
The cladistic biogeographic approach assumes a shared correspondence between phylogenetic history and geological history. The relationship between these histories can be seen in congruent patterns of different taxonomic and area cladograms (cladograms with taxon names replaced by distributions) fitting a given pattern of geological history. In this method, dispersal is assumed not to explain a disjunct distribution until vicariance can be falsified (Kluge 1989; Croizat, Nelson & Rosen 1975). Vicariance is a more parsimonious interpretation than dispersal for congruent area cladograms of different taxa, because the congruence can be explained by a single event (i.e., the rifting of a continent or orogeny). The same interpretation of distributions by dispersal would require concordant dispersal in the same sequence for many diverse taxa (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). The essence of vicariance biogeography is that barriers arise secondarily to divide up species. Vicariance events, because they are tied to earth history, can only be supported by a very limited range of phylogenetic patterns. Dispersal scenarios, because they can occur without any underlying congruent process, can be claimed to support an unlimited range of phylogenetic patterns.
Area cladograms that fit a hypothesized geographical fragmentation sequence may support vicariance, or at least do not falsify it. All distribution patterns can be explained by dispersal. Dispersal scenarios therefore should not be employed unless vicariance scenarios have been falsified.
Vicariance scenarios for freshwater fishes have the following potential falsifiers: (1) the phylogenetic pattern (sequence of lineage divergence) does not follow the timing of known geological processes (i.e. the sequence of fragmentation) (Figure 3), (2) members of particular lineages are younger than hypothesized related vicariance events (3) a species of the group under study is found on either side of a supposed barrier to dispersal (4) molecular clocks or sequence divergence times reliably show that lineages have diverged after the particular vicariant events under study.
Dispersal will be the favored mechanism to explain a disjunct distribution when falsifiers of vicariance -- by adding assumptions to a vicariance hypothesis -- make dispersal a more parsimonious alternative. The possibility also exists that the current evidence is insufficient to select between alternative explanations of disjunct distributions.
Specimens were purchased from an aquarist company, Tangled Up In Cichlids or from specimens that were bought from Michigan pet stores by the author. Specimens have yet to be vouchered and officially placed in the UMMZ (Univeristy of Michigan Museum of Zoology) collections. Photographic records of the left side of the included fishes were taken before tissue samples were removed. Molecular sequences were obtained from the University of Michigan Sequencing Core after DNA purification and amplification were completed by the author. Additional sequences were obtained from GenBank. Table 1 lists the species used in this study and tissue voucher numbers and GenBank accession numbers. Outgroups included members of Labridae (wrasses), the possible sister group to Cichlidae (Streelman & Karl 1997). Closely related Indian cichlids in the genus Etroplus were included to verify monophyly of the Neotropical species.
Tissue was preserved in 70% ethanol and frozen at -20°C prior to DNA extraction. DNA was extracted from fin clips, or from muscle tissue from the right side of the specimen using Proteinase K dissolution. Tissue was then purified using a Qiagen Tissue Extraction Kit following the manufactures protocol. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was performed using Platnium Taq polymerase following the manufactures protocol to amplify about 600 base pairs (bp) of 16S ribosomal subunit and a 650 bp segment of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI). The primers 16S ar-L 5'-CGCCTGTTTATCAAAACAT-3' and 16S br-H 5'-CCGGTCTGAACTCAGATCAGT-3' (Koucher et al.1989; Palumbi 1996) were used to amplify 16S. The primers LCO1490 5'-GGTCAACAAATCATAAAGATATTGG-3' and HCO2198 5'-TAAACTTCAGGGTGACCAAAAAATCA-3' from Folmer et al. (1994) were used to amplify CO1. Amplification for 16S were carried out in 30 cycles according to the following protocol denaturing for 2 minutes at 95°C, annealing at 55°C for 1 minute and an extension for 2 minutes at 72°C, with an additional terminal extension for 72°C for 10 minutes. Amplification for COI was carried out in 35 cycles to the following temperature profile: denaturing for 20 seconds at 95°C, annealing for 1 minute at 45°C and an extension for 2 minutes at 72°C, with an additional terminal extension for 72°C for 10 minutes.
Sequences were aligned (using complete alignment option) and compiled in CLUSTAL X (Thompson et al. 1994). Indels were treated as missing characters in all analyses.
Parsimony and Maximum likelihood analyses were carried out in PAUP* 4.0b3 (Swafford, 1998). Heuristic searches were carried out with 1000 replicates (random addition of taxa, ACCTRAN optimization). For maximum likelihood 100 replicate heuristic was done and the assumption set is as follows: the transition/transversions rate was set as 2:1; base frequencies were set to empirical frequencies; for the variable sites option, equal rates for all sites option was selected; starting values for all parameters was parsimony based approximations, Rogers-Swafford method was selected for starting branch lengths.
Twenty 16S rDNA sequences were obtained by the author and 22 from GenBank (Table 1). Unfortunately no cichlid COI sequences for the taxa used in this study are available on GenBank.
Figure 3 shows the strict consensus parsimony tree of the 16S data alone. Total tree length was of 856 steps. Although the Neotropical taxa are shown to be monophyletic with a bootstrap support of 80, and cichlids are monophyletic with a support of 68, there is very little resolution within the Neotropical clade. There are two possible explanations for the resolution, that either this molecule is unable to resolve this level of divergence or that the species tree is a hard polytomy. Given that the combined data set of both 16S and COI genes are better resolved, it cannot be concluded that these species relationships is an irresolvable hard polytomy.
Figure 4, shows the resulting consensus tree of a maximum parsimony heuristic analysis of 1000 bootstraps. Central and North American species form a monophyletic group that includes the Greater Antillean species. This entire clade is nested within the South American clade. Cichlidae and the Neotropical cichlids are found to be monophyletic. The Antillean cichlids do not form a clade. The Cuban Nandopsisramsedeni is found to be sister to a subclade of Mexican and Central American species and the Hispaniolan species Cichlasoma haitiensis is in the poorly resolved grouping outside of the clade that includes N. ramsedeni. The consistency index is 0.471963 and the retention index 0.567878.
Figure 5 shows the maximum likelihood tree, which is largely congruent with the parsimony tree. The Mexican and Central American species still form a clade nested with the South American clade. A major distinction is the position of the Greater Antillean species. Cichlasoma haitiensis is recovered as sister to C. oblongus a Guatemalan species; Nandopsis ramsedeni is recovered in a similar position to where it was in the parsimony analysis as sister to a larger clade of Central and Mexican cichlids.
Unfortunately due to the disparity of where the Antillean cichlids were recovered in the likelihood and parsimony analyses, little conclusively can be said in regards to their biogeography. Both analyses (likelihood and parsimony) found that the Antillean cichlids do not form a clade, so it can be stated with certainty that these cichlids are derived from different lineages. The Antillean fauna therefore did not arise from a single ancestral species dispersing across a marine environment or landbridge, or from one species dispersing during a vicariant event. At least two separate dispersal events or ancestors are necessary to explain these data.
Since both analyses (Figure 4 and 5) find the Antillean cichlids nested within the Central American clade, these analyses find evidence to falsify the GAARlandia hypothesis of Itturalde and MacPhee (1999). Evidence to support this hypothesis would have been to recover the Antillean cichlids as sister to some South American clades instead of nested within the Mexican-Central American clade.
With the Central American clade nested within the South American clade and the Neotropical clade recovered as monophyletic in this and other analyses (Sparks 2001; Farias 2001; Streelman et al. 1998; Zardoya 1996) it is apparent that South American taxa dispersed to Central America to colonize habitats there -- fitting the hypotheses of Myers (1938, 1966) and Bussing (1985). Although there is evidence against dispersal across a South American landbridge of cichlids to give rise to the Antillean cichlids, there is no evidence supporting or falsifying the Rosen coalescence hypothesis or overwater dispersal being the mechanism for cichlids getting from Central America to the Greater Antilles. Both scenarios are still plausible. However, the cladistic biogeographic approach uses a simplicity criterion to favor one of these scenarios over the other.
Dispersal from Central America across the marine environment given the topologies of these analyses would require that the species that dispersed either speciated on these islands from at least two separate dispersal events, or that the species that currently are on the islands had their source mainland populations subsequently extirpated. There is no fossil record of any Cuban or Hispaniolan species on Central America or vice versa. Interestingly the relationship of the Antillean cichlids rules out successful dispersal events from one island to the other. Not only are there not shared populations of species between the islands, but also the species on Cuba and Hispaniola are not even closely related.
That the Antillean cichlids are not monophyletic still fits the Rosen hypothesis of drift vicariance. According to Rosen (1975, 1985) Jamaica, the Caymans, southwest Hispaniola, and western Cuba were connected to different parts of southern and eastern parts of the Yucatan and northern parts of Central America. This scenario would entail different cichlid species giving rise to the separated lineages in Cuba and Hispaniola.
The simplest scenario is that of Rosen (1975, 1985) rather than of a dispersalist scenario of overwater dispersal. Given the dispersalist view point cichlids on the Antilles would have had to disperse the hundreds of kilometers from Central America to Hispaniola and Cuba in two separate dispersal events, but not the 77 kilometers between these islands. The vicariance approach requires a unique event, to explain the current Antillean distributions of cichlids, atherinids (silversides), poeciliids and other Cyprinodontiformes, synbranchid eels and gars, since they all have largely congruent cladograms (Rosen 1975; Rauchenberger 1988). The dispersalist scenario assumes each of these lineages independently dispersed from Central America to these islands.
There are several interesting non-biogeographic outcomes recovered in the tree topologies that will interest aquarists. Cichlasoma (= Archocentrus) citrenellum is perhaps the most popular aquarium trade cichlid. Three individuals of this species were samples in the analyses. C. citrenellum10 (as labeled in the trees and Table 1) is from a pet store, and has presumable been in the aquarium trade for many generations leaving it susceptible to hybridization with other captive bred species. C. citrenellum1 is an F1 generation from wild caught individuals, and Archocentrus citrenellumAF0490 is a GenBank sequence from this same species reported with its synonomized generic name. The later two individuals are identical but C. citrenellum10 is recovered as forming a sister relationship with Amphillophus lyonsi. Supporting that at least some aquarium populations of this species, sold as the Midas cichlid for its golden color, are hybrids of other species. Another popular aquarium population known as the blue dempsey Nandopsis octofasciatus has been reported in the aquarium literature as a hybrid of two distantly related taxa and not related to the common dempsey Cichlasoma octofasciatus. In these analyses the blue dempsey is found to be identical to individuals reported in GenBank and other populations of dempsey supporting the idea that this population is simply a color morph of the common wild population.
Clearly the other Antillean species need to be sampled, as should the COI data from those species from which only 16S data is sampled. Finding that the additional two species from the islands are not related to the two species sampled here would favor a dispersalist scenario over a vicariant one. A vicariance scenario would predict that the ancestor of the species on each island arrived there as part of a single vicariant event and speciated on that islands. A morphological analysis would be useful because the fossil species Cichlasoma woodringi should be included in these analyses, and a morphological study would act as a congruent and independent test of the congruent molecular topologies found here.

The seasonality of cholera remains a mystery, it exhibits robust regularity but with important geographic variation. Furthermore, its environmental drivers are poorly defined because the seasonal pattern varies in space, with different lags relative to rainfall, one major potential driver. For example, two peaks per year are the typical pattern described for cholera in Bangladesh and former Bengal, with a decline in the summer during the monsoons, but only one peak is present in other regions of former British India and current Brazil, which coincides with the rainy season (see review by Pascual et al., 2002; and Codeço, 2001).
A better understanding of cholera's seasonality is key to identify the regional mechanisms behind the described effect of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (Pascual et al., 2000; Koelle and Pascual, 2004). It is also fundamental to build scenarios for cholera with global change. Both climate variability (ENSO) and climate change are likely to act on infectious diseases through the modulation of the seasonal cycle and the crossing of environmental thresholds (Pascual and Dobson, 2005).
Studies in volunteers confirmed that the ingestion of a dosage between 107 and 1011 bacteria, depending on the method (for example, neutralizing stomach acidity, or with different foods), develop in an infection (Kaper et al., 1995); consequently, bacteria density is considered a major indicator of potential outbreaks. Moreover, the existence of two possible routes of transmission for cholera includes rainfall in the seasonal cycle of cholera cases. Primary transmission presumably occurs from a reservoir of the pathogen Vibrio cholerae in the aquatic environment. Brackish water and estuaries, has been shown to provide adequate environmental conditions for the bacterium to survive outside the human host (Colwell et al., 1977). Secondary or "human-to-human" transmission occurs via the ingestion of fecally contaminated water, and some times through food (Glass et al., 1991). The relative importance of these two routes of transmission is highly debated; however, if a strong feedback exists from infected hosts to the natural environments, the distinction between the two is blurred.
Based on these two transmission routes, Dobson et al. (in prep.) have previously proposed the following mechanisms behind the bimodal seasonal pattern of cholera in Bangladesh. The first peak occurs in the spring, during the dry season when temperature warms up, because the bacterium thrives in the environment where it is also more highly concentrated, and humans' interaction with water bodies increases (i.e. primary transmission). The monsoon leads to a decline in cholera in the summer, as heavy rainfall dilutes the concentration of the pathogen in the environment and both salinity and pH, favorable conditions for the bacteria, decay. This dilution effect of rainfall represents a negative influence. However, a positive effect would follow with an increase in cholera as humans concentrate in the flooded landscape and existing sanitary conditions break down (i.e. secondary transmission).
This seasonal model provides predictions for both endemic and epidemic areas. In endemic regions, cholera should exhibit a negative association with rainfall at zero lag (dilution effect) and a positive correlation at positive lags reflecting the increase in secondary transmission after the rains. However, in regions with long and sustained periods of rainfall, and consequently with low concentration of the pathogen in the aquatic reservoirs, there should be an increase in the local extinction of the disease. Hence, frequent fade-outs and an erratic behavior should be favored in regions with lower human populations.
To examine these predictions, we analyze the association of cholera and rainfall in space and time, investigating also the notion of a Critical Community Size for cholera (Keeling, 1997).
The predictions conceived from the hypothesis about the temporal dynamics of primary and secondary transmission can be evaluated studying historical records of cholera disease.
The area studied was the region of India known as Madras Presidency. The Madras Presidency was a
For each district, monthly cholera mortality data were collected from January 1892 until December 1940 and, during the same period, information about population size for some of the districts was obtained. In addition, from January 1901 to December 1970, several meteorological stations located in the region collected daily rainfall data. A monthly estimation of rainfall during that period was calculated averaging the stations and taking in consideration the historical borders of the districts. Because of the partial overlapping, analyses considering both data only included the period from January 1901 to December 1940. On the other hand, whenever cholera mortality or rainfall was analyzed independently from each other, the full time series was used (1892-1940 and 1901-1970 respectively).
A spatial correlogram (Bailey and Gatrell, 1995, Fortin et al., 2002) was performed to detect up to which amplitude, or distance, the area of influence of each district extends when cholera mortality is the variable under study. With the distance obtained (200 Km.), proximity matrices, that determinate which districts are considered as neighbors, were defined. Once that a neighborhood was defined spatial autocorrelation analyses were performed considering both cholera and rainfall dataset. The well-known (global) spatial autocorrelation index, Moran's I (Cliff and Ord, 1973), and its modified version, which incorporated the computation for local variations, Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) (Anselin, 1995, Fortin et al., 2002), was obtained for the mean values of both time series.
In order to study the interactions between cholera and rainfall the coefficient of correlation between the time series was calculated including a lag between the series ranging from 0 to 12 months (with rainfall preceding cholera). Then, both global and local spatial autocorrelation indexes, using the coefficients of correlation as input, were calculated. Whereas Moran's I evaluates the degree of global clustering, LISA index permits local variations and hence the identification of "hot-spots" and "cold-spots" or clusters where high and low values for the interaction cholera-rainfall were observed is possible.
Spatial autocorrelation shows a static picture of the distribution of cholera, however, dynamical measures are necessary to have a complete perspective. Two of such measures were considered here: the Critical Community Size and the seasonal variability of rainfall. The Critical Community Size (CCS), the population size below which a disease dies out in the troughs between epidemics, reflects the dynamics underlying outbreaks (Keeling, 1997). Hence, a qualitative measure of the CCS was obtained for the districts were population data was available. For this analysis, a period of at least two consecutive months without mortality was considered a die out of the disease, known as fadeout. In addition, the spatial autocorrelation of the amount of fade-outs also was analyzed. Finally, the incorporation of the dynamic pattern manifested by rainfall fulfills the previous analysis. All the districts exhibited a strong peak in rainfall due to the so-called southwest monsoon (for a detailed explanation see Krishnamurthy and Kinter III, 2002). Some districts exhibit high precipitation values can last for even 6 months, and after such a long rain season the rainfall diminish to irrelevant levels during the rest of the year, whereas in others districts the monsoon effect is typically shorter (3 or 4 months) and a second peak of rainfall occurs within an interval of few months. Exceptions to this second peak are the districts on the Arabian Sea. Determining how many times and for how long the monthly-accumulated rainfall exceeded a threshold value-fixed at a value of 25% over the expected rainfall per district-allowed to discriminate districts with two rainfall peaks per year from those with only one. This characterization of districts was later analyzed considering the variability of cholera observed in conjunction with the rainfall patterns.
The methods described in the previous section provide evidence to describe the variability manifested in rainfall, mortality due to cholera, and their interconnection in light of the situations expected by our hypotheses.
The low values obtained for the spatial autocorrelation, measured by the global index Moran's I, indicate that there is not significant spatial clustering when both cholera mortality and rainfall are independently considered; however, when Moran's I is evaluated for the correlation between them, the index reaches significance (Table 1). Hence, a notable spatial association emerged when the interconnection between cholera and rainfall was explored.
Considering the locality for cholera mortality, the results provided by the LISA index delimited one small-size cluster (districts number 17, 24 and 26) with high values in the central southern part of the region under analysis, and a second cluster close to the first, also small in size (districts 15 and 18) and with low values compared to that in the high-value cluster. In contrast, for rainfall, a medium-size cluster (districts number 4, 5, 11 and 14) of low values appears in the central northern region. As well as the global clustering changes when the correlation between cholera and rainfall is analyzed, the pattern exhibited locally is also dramatically different (Fig. 2): one big-size cluster with high values is formed in the northeast region (districts 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 23, denoted as HIGH-HIGH in the figure); a second big-size cluster with low values is found in the central southern area (districts 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 24, 25 and 26, LOW-LOW); and three one-district clusters with relative low values, respecting their neighborhood, are also delimited (districts 12, 13 and 20). This pattern could be read as follows: In the northeast area, the correlation between rainfall and cholera without considering any temporal lag between the series is reach positive significant values, whereas in the central southern area the values are negative. When the local clustering evaluated with LISA index is studied introducing time lags between cholera and rainfall time series, with rainfall preceding cholera, a similar pattern is obtained when the lag is 10, 11 and 12 months, whereas the pattern is inverted-negative correlation in the northeast region and positive correlation in the central southern area -- for values ranging from 3 to 7, and finally the pattern is not clear for 1, 2, 8 and 9 months (Fig. 3 shows some of the lags).
Considering the dynamic aspects of this study, the CSS plotted in Figure 4 shows that districts with higher density have a lower number of fadeouts, while in the less dense districts the presence of the disease is frequently interrupted. It is very important to notice the high variability present in the dataset, but in these low populated districts, cholera can be seen as a disease with irregular outbreaks, whereas in the former districts cholera exhibits an endemic behavior. The Moran's I value considering the amount of fadeouts for each district, Table 1, indicates that there is not spatial clustering. Local clustering analysis considering the amount of fadeouts does not reach statistical significance; however, mapping the amount of fadeouts more fadeouts occurs in the northern districts (Fig. 5). A similar geographical pattern is obtained when the duration of fadeouts is considered, with the northern districts having longer fadeouts than the southern ones.
Finally, a classification considering the mean annual duration of the rain season determined three different regions (Fig. 5): a northern area with long rain season (districts 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 20 and 23); a Central area with a moderate length of rainfall (districts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 14, 16, 19 and 21); and a southern region with two short wet season (districts 17, 18, 22, 24, 25 and 26).
The results obtained in this work allow splitting the Madras Presidency into two main regions, Northeastern and Southern, with different cholera seasonality and different patterns of association between cholera and rainfall. In particular, the southern region exhibits a pattern which is similar with the one described in the literature for Bangladesh (Bouma and Pascual, 2001), with the whole seasonal pattern shifted in time in accordance with the earlier dominant monsoon season. This seasonal pattern is then characteristic of "endemic" regions, with regular and persistent infection, and contrasts with the stochastic nature of "epidemic" regions with only one sporadic peak coincident with rains and recurrent fadeouts.
The northeastern region comprehends the following districts: Godivari East (7), Godivari West (8), Guntur (9), Kistna (10), Kurnool (11), and Vizgapatam (23). In this area, a positive correlation between cholera and rainfall is shown and in general, one epidemic peak of cholera mortality per year is presented. Moreover, these districts display longer and more frequent fadeouts, suggesting a non-permanent presence of the disease.
The southern region including the districts of Nilgiris (15), North Arcot (16), Ramnad (17), Salem (18), South Arcot (19),Trichinopoly (24), Coimbatore (25), and Madua (26). In this region, a negative association between cholera and rainfall is observed and two peaks of cholera mortality are commonly shown. Also in this region, shorter and infrequent (sporadic) fadeouts are observed, probably indicating a permanent presence of the disease.
The remaining districts (numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 20, 21, 22 and 23 in Fig. 1), located in the central and west regions exhibited an intermediate behavior between the ones presented in the two regions described above.
The bimodal Southern pattern is consistent with the predictions of our seasonal model (Dobson et al., in prep). This result provides the first quantitative evidence for both a positive and negative influence of rainfall on the seasonality of cholera, through its dilution effect on the pathogen and its enhancing effect of 'human-to-human' or secondary transmission. While the first effect has been described in the literature, the second is novel for the bimodal cholera pattern.
The unimodal monsoonal Northern pattern combined with its stochastic nature suggests that in places where secondary transmission cannot be sustained over time, an environmental reservoir of pathogenic Vibrio cholerae is not effectively maintained. Thus this human feedback from infected individuals to aquatic reservoirs appears critical to sustain the so-called primary transmission, which underscores the importance of secondary transmission itself. Sustained periods of rain further dilute the pathogen in aquatic reservoirs and epidemics occur during the rainy season, presumably through immigration of infected individuals and the consequent secondary route of transmission.
Traditionally, the explanation for the occurrence of outbreaks after rainfall periods only considers the environment driven infection processes and basically states that moderate rainfalls are able to create optimal (or quasi optimal) environmental conditions for the spread of Vibrio cholerae (Lipp et al., 2002). The findings presented here supported the hypothesis that a long wet season is able to create a dilution effect avoiding the bacteria to anchor in the environment (Pascual et. al, 2002), but due to the aggregation of people, probably because of floods, which disproportionally raises the human-to-human oral-fecal mechanism of contagion and drastically reduces the quality of sanitary conditions, the disease is able to settle when is introduced from an endemic area. Consequently, rainfall plays two different roles concerning cholera dynamics: short wet seasons favor cholera leading to an environment driven disease, whereas long wet seasons entail an infectious dynamics.
In conclusion, the dynamics of cholera can be defined by two very different regions inside the Madras Presidency: the southern endemic region and the northeast region that exhibits an epidemic behavior. A possible explanation for the re-emergence of the disease in epidemic zones can be the migration of infective agents (food, water or people) from the endemic zones. Although more information is necessary to evaluate explicitly such scenario, our findings may be used to design health care polices in order to avoid massive mortality situations.

The palmnut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis) is a monotypic species found along the coast, estuaries and rivers of sub-Saharan Africa in areas where oil and raffia palms also occur. This vulture is relatively common but not abundant in Mozambique and rare in northern Zululand, Botswana and Zimbabwe; it is considered South Africa's rarest breeding bird. The diet of Gypohierax largely consists of palm fruits, but also includes many fish, crabs, snails and other small animals, as well as other birds. (Ginn et al., 1989)
An alternative name of Gypohierax is the vulturine fish eagle (Ginn et al., 1989), reflecting its many similarities, both dietary and morphological (especially talon structure), to the sea and fish eagles (genus Haliaeetus). The phylogenetic placement and evolutionary history of Gypohierax is unclear. Brown and Amadon (1968) included Gypohierax as a member of a monophyletic clade of Old world vultures, but also suggested a sister relationship between the sea eagles and Gypohierax . Jollie (1977), Suschkin (1899), and Brown and Amadon (1968) note that Gypohierax resembles the Egyptian vulture (Neophron) and may be a member of a monophyletic clade of all Old World vultures (including Neophron). Holdaway (1994), in a phylogenetic analysis of osteological characters, finds support for a monophyletic clade of vultures where the palmnut vulture is the earliest diverging vulture.
Several phylogenetic analyses based on mitochondrial DNA and morphological traits support paraphyly of the Old World vultures (Seibold and Helbig, 1995; Mundy et al., 1992). Two clades are identified: the Gyps-Aegypius-Necrosyrtes clade includes the genera of its name as well as Torgos, Trigonoceps, and Sarcogyps, and is sister to the Snake eagles; and, the Gypaetus-Neophron clade, is sister to Pernis apivorus, including only the two genera for which it is named. Gypohierax is not included in these analyses, but Seibold and Helbig propose that it most likely represents a third independent evolutionary line separate from the other Old World vulture clades.
In summary, it has been proposed that Gypohierax (1) forms a clade independent from other vulture lineages, (2) is sister to the sea eagles (Haliaeetus), (3) is a member of a monophyletic clade of Old World vultures, and (4) is most closely related to the Egyptian vulture (Neophron). The Old World vultures have been proposed to be (1) a monophyletic clade, (2) two separate distinct monophyletic clades (overall polyphyly), and (3) three separate distinct monophyletic clades (overall polyphyly).
DNA was extracted from tissue and feather samples using the Qiagen DNEasy Extraction kit. An addition of dithiothreitol was used for samples from feathers. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out using two primers pairs for cytochrome B (CytB; Sorenson et al. 1999). PCR and sequencing was done following protocols in Mindell et al. (1997). Additional CytB sequences for analyses were obtained from GenBank (Aegypius monachus, gi 1050567; Trigonoceps occipitalis, gi 1050710; Sarcogyps calvus, gi 1050699, Gypaetus barbatus, gi 1050621; and Neophron percnopterus, gi 1050666).
Conceptually translated protein sequences were aligned by eye and this alignment was imposed on the nucleotides. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using parsimony and maximum likelihood (ML) criteria for the dataset. For parsimony analysis, a bootstrap analysis was done using Winclada software (Nixon, 2002), 1000 replications with 100 search reps and ten starting trees per rep. A Bayesian inference (BI) approach, which is related to ML analyses, (Mau et al., 1999; Yang and Rannala) was performed with Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo, or (MC)3, to approximate the posterior probabilities (PP) of the trees in MrBayes 2.1 (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist). Bayesian inference has advantages over other methods of phylogenetic inference in interpretation of results, consistency (Wilcox et al.) and computational speed (Larget and Simon); however, as always, reliability of the results depends on appropriateness of the model, and some simulations have demonstrated artifactually high PP support values (Suzuki et al., 2002). Base frequencies and gamma distribution (with eight rate categories) were estimated each run. A general time reversible model was used, which includes six substitution types. The search was run twice, starting from random trees with four simultaneous Markov chains, sampling every 50 generations for 1,000,000 generations. The proportion of searches in which any given node (set of relationships) is found during the chain is an approximation of its PP, and provides an indication of support for that node based on the dataset.
The sequence data set of 1017 nucleotides from 27 species aligned with no indels or stop codons. Of the 1017 nucleotide positions, 458 were variable and 339 were parsimony informative.
Each amino acid is coded for by up to six different codons (synonymous codons). The relative frequency of each synonymous codon should be equal to that of the its related synonymous codons if none of the codons are favored by selection or mutation. However, many organisms have been found to have biases in synonymous codon usage (Sharp et al., 1988). Codon bias was also found in this data set of Accipitridae for most amino acids (table 1). The largest biases were found in valine (V) and serine (S), where one codon was at least three times more frequent than expected. Synonymous substitutions (10815 occurrences) were observed ten times more often than nonsynonymous substitutions (1060 occurrences).
The parsimony analysis shows polyphyly of the Old World vultures based on the cyt b dataset (Figure 1). Sarcogyps, Trigonoceps and Aegypius form a sister clade to Necrosyrtes and Gyps. There is strong support for the existence of two sister clades (95 boostrap value), but weak support for the placement of species within these clades. Circaetus remains part of an unresolved polytomy not within this derived vulture clade. The remaining three vultures Neophron, Gypaetus and Gyophierax form a much earlier diverging unresolved polytomy.
The Bayesian analysis shows polyphyly of the Old World vultures based on the cyt b dataset (Figure 2). Neophron, Gypaetus and Gyophierax form an early diverging monophyletic clade sister to Pernis, while the other Old World vultures form a much more derived monophyletic clade. Support for the early diverging clade of vultures is moderate (74 PP). The more derived vulture clade consists of two sister groups, one formed by Trigonoceps, Aegypius and Sarcogyps, and the other including Gyps, and Necrosyrtes. Support for the monophyly of this clade is high (95 PP), as is support for the existence of two clades within the derived vulture clade (100 PP) Circaetus is sister to the derived clade of vultures with moderate support (85 PP).
Both the Bayesian and ML analyses support polyphyly of the Old World vultures based on this cyt b dataset. The analyses agree that the more derived vultures form a monophyletic clade consisting of two sister groups as found by Seibold and Helbig (1995). The first group includes Sarcogyps as the earliest diverging species, then Trigonoceps and finally Aegypius as the most derived species in this group. The second group has Necrosyrtes as sister to the Gyps pecies. These results coincide for the most part with the anlyses done by Seibold and Helbig, however, they support a sister relationship between Necrosyrtes and Gyps not found by Seibold and Helbig.
The Bayesian analysis suggests that Gypohierax , Neophron and Gypaetus form a monophyletic clade of early diverging vultures sister to a species long-supposed to be early diverging: Pernis. The sister relationship between Gypaetus and Neophron was supported by Seibold and Helbig's analysis and is reflected in shared morphological, embryonic development, vocalizations and feeding behavior characteristics of the two species. Although Neophron and Necrosyrtes have been considered closely related, they are best considered in terms of convergence according to this analysis (White, 1950).
The placement of Circaetus although unresolved in the ML analysis, is potentially sister to the derived vulture group as it is shown in the Bayesian analysis. This placement was proposed by Mundy et al. {, 1992}, although not supported by Seibold and Helbig's cyt b analysis. Mundy et al. also suggested a sister relationship for Circaetus and Terathopius. Both genera specialize on snakes as prey and have morphological adaptations for this lifestyle. Given the convergence seen between Neophron and Necrosyrtes in this analysis, it remains uncertain if Circaetus and Terathopius are sister or convergent species.
The placement of Gypohierax is supported strongly by the Bayesian analysis, as sister to the Gypaetus-Neophron early diverging clade of vultures. A sister relationship between Gypohierax and Neophron was suggested by Brown and Amadon (1968), but has not been tested before with molecular evidence. Osteological evidence suggests a sister relationship between Gypohierax , and Aegypius, Gyps, and Necrosyrtes that was not supported with this cyt b dataset (Holdaway, 1994). If Gyophierax is truly sister to Gypaetus and Neophron, as suggested by this dataset, this relationship may help identify morphological characters that are convergent in many of the Old World vultures which have led to misplacement and confusion in previous phylogenetic analyses of vultures.

As Platt (1964) argued, hypothesis-testing is essential to rapid scientific progress, with dispositive studies guiding it efficiently along a "logical tree" akin to a chemist's flow chart or "conditional computer program." Moreover, this "strong inference" approach attains its greatest efficiency when multiple alternative hypotheses are tested simultaneously, enabling researchers to quickly eliminate fruitless branches of the logical tree (Platt 1964).
Now that many ecologists rely upon computer programming to generate models and run simulations, the question arises of whether such experience in constructing parsimonious sequences of conditional propositions has promoted the use by these scientists of a hypothesis-testing approach in their empirical ecological investigations. Furthermore, because scientific investigation is strongly influenced by the culture in which it is embedded (Kuhn 1970), perhaps even ecologists who do not themselves engage in programming-aided theoretical studies would nevertheless display heightened hypothesis-testing if they are affiliated with institutions that emphasize computer reliant theoretical research.
Based upon these considerations, I propose the Programming Promotes Hypothesis-Testing Hypothesis (PPHTH), which states that ecologists occurring in habitats in which computer-aided theoretical modeling is emphasized should show increased frequency, rigor, and efficiency of hypothesis testing when compared with ecologists from other milieus. In the present paper, as a test of this hypothesis, I compare empirical ecological research produced at an institution that places an extremely high emphasis upon computer-assisted, theoretical studies with empirical ecological studies emanating from a more broad-based institution.
For the computer-rich environment, I chose the University of Chicago's Department of Ecology and Evolution (Chicago), home to a self-styled "naturalist" publication in which the most frequently studied species are named "x" and "y", and in which a computer monitor passes for an observation blind. Moreover, this university served as Platt's intellectual home, as he was a professor there (Platt 1964) and, as a whole, it has historically been steeped in theory, from Fermi in physics to Friedman in finance. I compared research of ecologists who are Chicago professors with research produced by ecologists who are professors of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor ( Michigan).
The latter institution, while certainly strong in ecological theory, does not, unlike the former, place such a strong emphasis on computer programming that its graduate school application largely comprises an assessment of such skills (Rosenthal, pers. obs.). In other respects, however, the institutions are similar, especially in that they both have highly prominent ecological research programs.
For Chicago, I visited the Department of Ecology and Evolution web page listing faculty research areas (http://pondside.uchicago.edu/ecol-evol/research/), identifying as ecologists all those professors listed under the Ecology heading. For Michigan, my search similarly started at the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology website listing faculty research interests (http://www.eeb.lsa.umich.edu/eebfaculty.asp). However, because this site did not have a separate list for ecology or ecologists, I identified as ecologists those professors for whom the word ecology appeared in the description of their field of interest. For both sites, sampling was conducted in February, 2002.
After the ecologists were identified, ecological publications were selected in the following manner: I visited each ecologist's individual web page, and went through his or her posted list of publications in reverse chronological order (with publication titles within the same year examined in alphabetical order), up to and including 1997, if necessary, until one suitable publication title was encountered. Publications were excluded if they were books rather than journal articles; or if they were not available either online or at the Shapiro Science Library; or if their titles reflected material that was either not ecological in nature (e.g., single species ethological studies); or clearly not explanatory in nature (e.g., an account of fish recruitment rates) or purely theoretical, without an empirical component. For some of the ecologists, no suitable publication was found, and therefore these individuals were not represented in the study.
Because of the frequent changes in institutional affiliations prevalent in academia, it is quite likely that some of the publications selected in the above manner were written, submitted or published prior to the ecologist's affiliation with their current institution. However, I decided that this should not preclude the inclusion of such publications in the current study, because: 1) their current institutions presumably selected faculty who reflected their own institutional cultures; and 2) the faculty members presumably chose institutions that encouraged their own approaches. Therefore, the different degrees of emphasis on theoretical approaches, and the predicted consequences for hypothesis testing should be reflected even in such prior publications.
Co-authorship of papers was not a bar to their inclusion in the study, as elimination of studies having multiple authors would have reduced the number of reviewed articles to an unworkably small number (quite close to zero). Moreover, as co-authored studies were included from both institutions, this approach should not affect the outcome of a comparison between the two.
For the purposes of this study, the hypothesis testing process was defined as containing the following four essential elements: 1) proposal of an a priori hypothesis (a posteriori hypotheses being excluded here because, by definition, they are not tested within the published studies within which they appear); 2) formulation of at least one factual prediction predicated upon this hypothesis, such that results contrary to the prediction would necessitate rejection of the hypothesis; 3) performance of a test to determine whether the prediction is borne out; and 4) comparison of the test's results to those predicted by the hypothesis, yielding a conclusion that the hypothesis has accordingly been rejected or supported.
In operationalizing the four elements outlined above, I emphasized substance, rather than form, such that:
The hypothesis-testing activity in the two populations of publications was assessed with respect to frequency, rigor, and efficiency as follows:
For each publication, the presence or absence of each of the four functional elements was recorded. Only those publications having all four present were classified as hypothesis-testing ("HT"). I then computed the proportion of the total that were HT. If PPHTH were to obtain, the HT proportion should be higher in the Chicago than the Michigan sample.
Each publication was examined to determine if it purported to evaluate hypotheses (i.e., by explicitly making this assertion). For each institution, the proportion of such publications that also qualified as HT was then computed. This approach was undertaken in order to evaluate the relative success of the two institutions in achieving hypothesis testing when explicitly attempted. If PPHTH were to obtain, the proportion of "rigorous" studies should be higher in the Chicago than the Michigan sample.
Each HT publication was examined to determine if it tested multiple alternative hypotheses ("MAHs") was computed. For a publication to be designated as testing MAHs, it would need to have two or more non-null a priori hypotheses (as defined above) with each of them tested pursuant to the criteria listed above. I then computed the proportion of the HT publications that tested MAHs. If PPHTH were to obtain, the MAH proportion should be higher for the Chicago than the Michigan studies.
The individual evaluations of the selected studies are presented in Table 1.
The group comparisons for hypothesis-testing assays are displayed in Table 2. As Table 2 shows, whereas the values for hypothesis-testing frequency are the same for the two samples, those for both rigor and efficiency are higher in the Chicago sample.
The results of this study provide limited support, at most, for PPHTH. Although there was a higher efficiency value for the Chicago publications, this was simply due to the fact that its only hypothesis-testing article evaluated multiple alternative hypotheses. It would be an over-generalization-based solely upon this single episode of MAH evaluation -- to characterize the Chicago ecologists, as a whole, as more efficient in their hypothesis-testing.
On the other hand, the difference in the values for the rigor index is more likely to reflect an actual disparity between the ways in which ecological research is framed at the two institutions. Although at both departments only one out of the five reviewed studies met all the hypothesis-testing criteria, at Michigan a majority (3 of 5) of publications asserted that they were evaluating hypotheses. At Chicago, in contrast, the only study to mention hypotheses was the one that actually tested them. There, 3 of the remaining 4 studies (Dwyer et al. 1998; Pfister 1998; Wootton 2001) focused instead upon the parameterization of mathematical models. Thus, the institutional difference in rigor values might be due to the Michigan ecologists more frequently attempting to fit their research into a hypothesis-testing framework (whether justified or not) -- whereas the bulk of Chicago research addresses simulations and other mathematical manipulations.
The one prediction of PPHTH that clearly was not borne out was that of a higher frequency of hypothesis-testing in the Chicago publications. Instead, the frequency was identically low for both institutions, due perhaps to Chicago ecologists largely eschewing hypothesis-testing in favor of more purely theoretical investigations, while Michigan ecologists tackled topics that are of such scale that they pose practical obstacles to adequate testing (e.g., Pascual et al. 2000 ; Vandermeer et al. 2000).
In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that although a programming-oriented environment does not increase the frequency of hypothesis-testing, it does reduce the frequency with which it is claimed, thereby increasing its apparent rigor. Additionally, this environment might increase the efficiency of hypothesis-testing, but this effect is far from clear.

The goal of this lab was to acquaint ourselves with self compacting concrete (SCC), its properties, and testing methods used in the design and mixing of SCC. Given a given design mix we made our own SCC. Moreover, we became familiar with a number of tests designed specifically for use with fresh SCC. We also became familiar with the method of testing to find the compressive strength of cylindrical hardened concrete specimens.
Mix proportions were provided by the instructor, thus no design procedure was required.
There are no American standards for self compacting concrete, so we mixed our concrete per instructor's directions. First all coarse aggregate was placed in the mixer with about 1/3 of the water. Then sand was added to the mix and all was allowed to become saturated. Next we added the concrete and fly ash to the mix slowly, and allowed that to combine. A small portion of the superplasticizer was then added to the remaining water, and the majority of water was added to the mixer. Finally, the remaining superplasticizer was added to the water, and the water added to the concrete mix. This was allowed to mix for a few minutes. Then we let it set for 5 minutes, and mixed for a little longer. Once the concrete mix was uniformly blended, fresh concrete tests were performed and samples of SCC were placed into molds.
The unit weight of the fresh concrete can be determined following ASTM C-138. First, the weight and volume of a chosen cylinder must be recorded. The cylinder is then filled with fresh SCC, however it is not rodded due to its self compacting nature. Once the container is full, the excess concrete must be struck off with the rod. The filled cylinder is then weighed, and the unit weight of the concrete can thus be calculated.
The air content test can be performed following the ASTM C-231 procedure. This process requires a special apparatus made up of a measuring bowl, top section, pressure gage, and air pump. First the bowl is wetted and filled completely with SCC, which does not need to be rodded due to its self compacting nature. Excess concrete should be struck off, and the seal of the bowl should be cleaned. The top section is then attached to the bowl and locked in place. The petcocks must be in the open position on each side of the top section, and water must be slowly added to one side until it begins to spill out the other. The petcocks must both then be closed. Begin pumping air into the chamber until the reading is 3 tick marks past the 0 mark. Next hit the pressure release tab on top, allowing all air to escape. The final reading on the pressure gage represents the air content in the SCC. Repeat all steps by releasing the petcocks on the base once again and filling with water. Once a consistent reading can be taken, that is recorded as the percent air content in the SCC
This test requires a standard cone from the ASTM C-143 slump test. Also required is a strong nonabsorbent base at least 700mm square with a 500mm diameter circle drawn on the center. A stopwatch and ruler will also be needed. Begin by placing the cone small opening down on the center of the board. Then fill the cone completely with SCC in a timely fashion. Simultaneously start the stop watch and lift the cone up from the board at a constant speed. Stop the clock when the SCC reaches the drawn circle on the board. The recorded time is generally acceptable between 3-7 seconds. Finally, measure the diameter of the SCC circle in two places and take the average. Acceptable values range from 650-800mm.
This test requires an apparatus developed in Japan known as a V-shaped funnel. The funnel shaped like a V consists of a trap door on the bottom, which is locked closed and is then filled with about 12 liters of SCC to the top. Place a container underneath the funnel. Be prepared with a stopwatch and begin timing from when the trap door is released, then stop time when light can be seen through the bottom of the funnel. Immediately fill the funnel back up with the same SCC, after closing the trap door once again. Allow the SCC to set in the funnel for 5 minutes and repeat the same timing procedure. Record both times, and compare. A large segregation of materials will result in a much greater time for the 5 minute test. An acceptable time for the first flow test is about 10 seconds.
This test also requires a special apparatus, developed in Japan to be used for underwater concrete. This L-shaped box assesses the flow of concrete, especially when subjected to blocking by reinforcement bars. The box consists of a vertical and horizontal section, separated by a moveable gate. With the gate closed, the vertical portion is filled with SCC and allowed to set for one minute. The gate is then lifted allowing the SCC to flow through the horizontal section past the reinforcement bars. Once flow has stopped, two readings are taken: the height of the concrete at both ends of the horizontal section. These heights are then used to calculate the slope of the SCC; the height closest to the vertical end divided by the height furthest from that end. It is suggested that the maximum value of this ratio be 0.8.
Preparing specimens can be done according to ASTM C-192. In this lab we were asked to produce three sizes of specimens: 8 small cylinders (4"x8"), 2 large cylinders (6"x12"), and 4 beams (3"x4"x12"). Each mold was first greased so as to make concrete removal go smoother at a later time. All cylinders and beams were filled completely with SCC to the top of the mold. The large advantage of SCC is that it requires no pouring of layers, rodding, or tapping of the molds. It consolidates on its own, and only the excess concrete must be struck off the top to create a surface with a clean look.
All concrete specimens were capped by placing them in a pool of hot wax, allowing the wax to harden on the ends of the concrete, creating a smooth and consistent surface. This preparation allows the compression machine to get a flat even surface on the specimen so the load can evenly be distributed throughout the cylinder. Once capped and dry, a specimen can be placed in the machine, and its dimensions entered in accordingly. The machine then begins its test, using algorithms to determine the maximum load the specimen is able of handling. This force can then be recorded as the maximum compressive stress for that specimen, keeping in mind the number of curing days the concrete has had. Multiple cylinders' tests can be averaged for a more accurate result of fc'.
Generally following all procedures as stated above, we performed our design and mixing. Our design is based off data provided by the instructor. Table 3.1 provides all the values of mix proportioning for our SCC.
The following Table 3.2 gives results from all the tests that we performed on our fresh SCC. All test procedures were followed generally. Shown in parentheses are the acceptance criteria.
The following Table 3.3 gives results from the compressive strength tests that we performed on two of our previous concrete specimens.
Comparing our test results to the standards set forth by their procedures, our mix of concrete is adequate and meets all criteria.
The addition of fly ash and superplasticizer to our mix of concrete had large influences on the fresh concrete as well as it will on our hardened specimens of concrete. Superplasticizer mainly acts as an additive that significantly increases the workability of fresh concrete. Moreover, it allows higher strength concrete with lower amounts of water, and the same strength concrete with less cement content. It has been shown that an addition of a superplasticizer will not hurt the overall durability of concrete or increase its shrinkage and creep.
Fly ash's main effect is increasing the concrete's strength over time. It can also decrease concrete's permeability keeping harmful aggressive compounds on the surface. Shrinkage can also be reduced indirectly by reducing the amount of water required in the concrete.
SCC has many advantages as well as disadvantages. Advantages include: early stripping strengths, increased productivity, design flexibility, and pumpability. Other benefits are a decrease in noise levels, time required during placement, overall production costs, and wear and tare on equipment. Disadvantages consist of: sensitive mixing, possible segregation, long setting time, touchy quality control, no ASTM standards for mix design or testing, and changing location of ingredients can alter a whole mix of SCC.
Throughout this lab we gained experience in mix proportioning self compacting concrete. Using given data we were able to design concrete to meet specifications, and take these values into the lab. We then were capable of creating the design mix and forming our own batch of SCC mix. Furthermore we were able to properly sample the concrete, as well as perform V-funnel test, slump flow test, L-box test, unit weight test, and air content test. We gained practice in preparing molds of concrete to be later used in testing. Finally, our group gained familiarity with testing cylindrical concrete specimens for their compressive strength. The results of our lab were given in this report.

You recently requested that our department conduct a series of tests on a soil found at the proposed site of a new 100' long masonry dam, as well as tests on a coarse soil to be used as a filter material. You are concerned with the classification of the soils, their suitability for this construction, and the resulting seepage loss under the dam. Our results show the coarse sand is suitable for filter material, classified by ASTM as SP-Poorly Graded Sand. The foundation soil is classified by ASTM as SC-Clayey Sand. The use of the Hazen equation to find permeability was found to be significantly inaccurate. However, using our test data for permeability, Design #1 will have seepage of 0.274 ft3/day while Design #2 will have seepage of 0.164 ft3/day. We recommend lowering these seepage values in both designs by incorporating a 75' clay blanket on the water bed of the head end of the dam.
Your letter, sent on January 25, 2006, asked for us to test two soils to be used in the construction of a new masonry dam at your Glacier Way site. You are concerned with ASTM soil classification, suitability of the coarse soil as a filter material, and the effective seepage underneath the two different dam designs, both 100' in length. It's apparent that a series of tests must be conducted to find the gradation curves and permeability of each soil. The appropriate testing has been completed, and we submit our findings in this report.
Tests were performed on two different soil samples. Both were a dry and brown sand common to this area of Michigan. The first was very fine and was found locally in the excavation site of the new dam. The second was an external sand brought in to be used as a filter, being similar to the first, however more coarse in nature. Further tests were performed on each sample to find their ASTM classifications, gradation analysis, and respective permeability.
The following tests were performed on the soil samples:
Test-422 uses the shaking sieve method well known among engineers to analyze the gradation of soils. The-422 hydrometer test uses a standard hydrometer setup and data points are taken over a 18 hour period to determine the size gradation of finer soils.
Test-2434 uses an apparatus that keeps a constant head of water while allowing water to flow through a sample of soil. Time and the volume of water flowing are used to get flow rate, and thus the coefficient of permeability for the soil.
Test-5856 is similar to-2434 and the same data is recorded, however it allows the head of the water to fall over time. Likewise, the method of calculating the coefficient of permeability varies slightly.
All procedures were followed generally, and can be referenced in the CEE 445 laboratory course pack.
Shown below in Figure 2.1 is the graph of the grain size distribution curve of each soil, with the coarse sand on the left and the fine on the right. Full data sheets of the sieve analysis can be seen in Appendix A and the data for the hydrometer test can be seen in Appendix B.
Using the sieve analysis results, Table 3.1 below shows each soil classified according to standards set by ASTM. Calculations to determine classifications can be found in Appendix D.
The US Army Corps of Engineers sets criteria on soils used as filter material:
The permeability of the fine soil can be estimated using the Hazen's Equation:
Shown below in Table 3.2 are the calculated values for the soils' permeability. Full data sheets can be referenced in Appendix C.
The calculated value of the permeability using the Hazen's Equation is shown to be pretty inaccurate compared to that of the test results. The Hazen's Equation gives a value almost 3 times larger than the actual tested value. The main reason for this being that Hazen designed the equation to be generally accurate with uniform soils in a relatively loose condition, and our soil is graded well and is far from a uniform state. Moreover, it is merely an empirical formula and can not be accurate in all cases.
Given your attached masonry dam designs with drawn flownets, we were able to compute the seepage underneath each dam design. Calculations can be found in Appendix D.
Our results indicate that both dam designs will have to large of a resulting seepage. We recommend that a 75' clay blanket be introduced on the water bed at the head of the dam. This in turn will increase the travel distance of the flow channels for water, thus lowering effective seepage of the dam.
Design #1 was found to have a higher seepage of 0.274 ft3/day than Design #2, which had a seepage of 0.164 ft3/day. The foundation soil of the dam is classified as SC-Clayey Sand. The soil proposed in Design #1 as a berm is classified as SP-Poorly Graded Sand, and meets all Army Corps of Engineers criteria of soils to be used as filter material. In conclusion, both dams are adequate for construction with the addition of a clay blanket, and all soils meet criteria set forth by the Army Corps of Engineers and ASTM.

Several tests were administered per ASTM standards on supplied samples of soil obtained from the Glacier Way dam site. These tests ultimately determined if either of two proposed dam designs were acceptable. Gradation analysis was completed from data found by sieve and hydrometer tests conducted per ASTM standards D 421-85 and D-422-63 using an ASTM 152H hydrometer. This allowed us to classify the soil per the ASTM/USCS classification system D 2487-93. We also found the coefficient of permeability using permeameter tests and compared them against the empirically derived Hazen equation. Based on the gradation and permeabilities we determined the suitability of the coarse sand as a filter for dam design 1, and also estimated seepage loss under the dam for both designs. Each dam has a slightly different configuration but will ultimately be supported by these soils, therefore the stability and resistance to washout is crucial to the success of this project. The results of these tests determine what actions must occur before construction proceeds.
The soils have been found to be clayey sand and poorly graded sand for the fine and coarse samples, respectively. The gradation of the samples meets the Army Corps of Engineers criteria for soil restraint but fails to meet allowable filter permeabilities. Therefore, either a different filter media may be evaluated or design 2 may be chosen. For both soils, the Hazen approximation for permeability is not nearly within reason to allow this shorthand estimation to be used in the field. Unacceptable design 1 has an estimated seepage rate of 32.7 ft3/day compared to an improved 19.6 ft3/day for design 2. If this is deemed excessive several recommendations have been included that will get your project underway with minimal effort. All other data may be found on the data and calculation summary page, Appendix A.
William Piper Associates is planning to build a dam at the Glacier Way dam site. Two designs are being evaluated based on their subbase soil characteristics to ensure they do not fail under the expected conditions. Before construction of the dams, soil criteria for using a filter must be met and the seepage loss under the dam must satisfactorily meet or exceed requirements. On October 24, 2006, Michigan Soil Consultants was contacted and asked to carry out these tests.
Seepage losses can determine the performance of the dam over its expected lifetime. Without proper filter characteristics and seepage flow, the dam may fail in a variety of ways including possibly washing away or not functioning to its intended degree. This may result in an unattractive, inefficient, unsafe, and possibly unusable dam. The purpose of this report is to detail our procedures and test findings while drawing conclusions and making some recommendations to ensure the success of this project.
The remainder of this document consists of test procedures, data results, conclusions, and recommendations. All preliminary data sheets and subsequent calculations have been included at the end of the document in Appendices A through I. Appendix B shows the soil gradation curves for the soils and Appendix J shows the proposed dams and corresponding flownets.
To determine if these soils have satisfactory characteristics two important quantities were found. First, gradation analysis was completed according to ASTM standards D 421-85 and D 422-63. This included a hydrometer test for the fine soil using an ASTM 152H soil hydrometer. Additionally, constant and falling head tests were performed to determine the coefficients of permeability of both soils. It is important that the permeameter tests conducted in the lab use the soil sample compacted to the degree so that the relative density matches that of the in-situ relative density of 70%. Since this could affect the results much care was taken to ensure this was accomplished. The constant head test was performed in general accordance with ASTM D 2434-68, and the falling head used general laboratory procedures. These guidelines were generally followed and deviations that occurred are noted.
The soil classifications were found to be SC clayey sand and SP poorly graded sand for the fine and coarse sands respectively. These were found based on the soil gradation curves included in Appendix B as well as the uniformity coefficient Cu (equation 1) and coefficient of gradation Cz (equation 2).
Overall, the coarse soil is not acceptable to serve as a filter medium for the fine grain soil. Therefore, only design 2 is acceptable which has a seepage rate of 19.7 ft3/day. If this is acceptable then no further design modifications are necessary. A summary of numerical data, formulas, and calculations can be found in Appendix A, with additional data record sheets following. Summaries of these results are outlined below.
Soil restraint criteria were met however permeability criteria was not met. As a result either different filter media should be considered or dam design 2 should be evaluated further. The US Army Corps of Engineers has filter suitability criteria for dam designs utilizing a coarse grain filter with finer grain soil. This criteria is divided into two categories, soil restraint and permeability
Both soil restraint criteria were met, shown below in equations 3 and 4. Since these are satisfied the filter material is satisfactory for a dam application.
Unlike soil restraint criteria, permeability criteria was not met. Equation 5 must be satisfied for the soils to be deemed acceptable. This expression has been evaluated and is shown in Appendix A. This confirms that we may not choose to build dam design 1 with this filter media.
Fine soil permeability resulted in a value of 0.000002 cm/sec and for the coarse soil it was 0.016 cm/s. This result is intuitive as a coarse grained soil like gravel should transmit more fluid than one of little voids due to small particle size diameter.
The Hazen Equation, equation 6, is an empirical derivation of permeability and does not predict our measured values within reasonable tolerances. This formula results in permeability in mm/s, which can be converted to cm/s to be compared with the measured data.
This derivation resulted with a permeability of 0.029 cm/sec for the fine soil and 7.02 cm/sec for the coarse soil. Obviously these are extremely high when compared to actual values. Therefore, this shorthand equation should not be used for any field soil checks. This may have resulted from the rather poorly graded nature of the soils.
Furthermore, our fine soil D10 value of 0.017 mm falls below the recommended range of the equation applicability, (0.1 to 3.0 mm). Other soil types such as the clay in the fine soil may have influenced the results.
We have found the seepage to be 32.7 ft3/day for dam design 1 and 19.6 ft3/day for dam design 2. These were found using flownets that have been provided by the design engineer. After converting units for the permeabilities measured previously, we can use equation 7, which is a variation of Darcy's Law to compute the seepage.
The results from the data analysis demonstrates that the soil proposed to be used at William Piper Associates Glacier Way dam site is SP clayey sand and SP poorly graded sand for the fine and coarse sands respectively. These soils do not meet criteria satisfactorily for a successful dam using design 1. Here, the materials do not satisfy the criteria for the US Army Corp of Engineers permeability requirements, despite the acceptability of soil restraint. However, design 2 does not use a filter, which eliminates this inadequacy. Additionally, this design allows less seepage than dam design 1 at only 19.7 ft3/day compared to 32.7 ft3/day, which will provide a better end product that does not promote any piping and erosion that will yield a functional dam for a long time to come. Lastly, during field operations the empirically developed Hazen's Equation should not be use for field checks due to its giant discrepancy from actual measured values. All data has been summarized in Appendix A.
If dam design 2's seepage rate of 19.7 ft3/day is considered excessive several simple remedies can be offered. We recommend adding another seepage blanket upstream of the dam, which would be the most cost effective way to lengthen the dam. This will alter the flow beneath the dam by extending its flow path, which reduces seepage. Other modifications could be made to the materials, such as grout injection into the soil to reduce permeability further, allowing less seepage beneath the dam.

From your letter dated February 5, 2007, we understand that you intend to construct a dam at your Glacier Way site. There are two designs being proposed, both 100 ft in length. The main objectives of this report are to classify the coarse and fine soils given to us, determine the suitability of the coarse soil as a filter for the fine soil, determine the permeabilities of the two soils, determine the accuracy of Hazen's Equation on the approximation of the coefficient of permeability, and to determine the seepage loss beneath each of the two dam designs that are being proposed. We have completed the required tests to determine the above objectives. The purpose of this document is to present to you our findings, conclusions, and recommendations.
The classification of the coarse soil was found to be poorly graded sand, SP. The fine soil was found to be clayey sand, SC. The coarse sand passed each of the three criteria which proved its suitability as a filter for the fine sand.
The coefficients of permeability for the coarse soil and the fine soil were found to be 8.7x10-3 cm/sec and 6.57x10-7 cm/sec respectively. It was found that this approximation was inaccurate due to key assumptions made in the formulation of this equation. With this we would recommend to not use this approximation during the calculation of further coefficients of permeability.
The seepage losses beneath dam Design 1 and dam Design 2 were estimated at 10.35 cubic ft per day and 6.21 cubit feet per day, respectively. These values are excessive by our standards and further design changes need to be made. We would recommend the addition of a seepage blanket in front of each dam design which would effectively reduce the amount of seepage loss beneath the dam and in turn ensure the stability of your proposed dam.

Note: No ASTM standard for the falling head test performed on the fine soil.
An in house standard test was performed.
The necessary data for construction of the proposed dam at your Glacier Way Project follows. This data includes the soil classifications, filter suitability, coefficients of permeability, and the seepage losses beneath each of the two proposed dam designs.
It has been determined that the coarse sand is poorly graded sand, SP, and it has been determined that the fine sand is clayey sand, SC. These sand types were determined using the ASTM soil classification system and further calculations can be found in the appendix.
The coarse sand is a suitable filter for the fine sand. The suitability of the coarse sand as a filter is important because it shows us that the soil can properly drain without clogging of the pores in the coarse sand and without washing out through the coarse sand. So here the filter is the coarse sand diameter and the soil is the fine sand diameter values that were obtained from Table 1 above. We will be using the US Army Corps of Engineers' procedure to help determine the soils suitability as follows:
(1) and (2)
Through our testing, we were able to determine the coefficient of permeability of both the coarse soil and the fine soil provided. The following values are as follows:
(4)
The calculations and data from these tests can be found on pages 7 and 9 in the Appendix.
Hazen's Equation has been found to be inaccurate when compared to our test results of the fine soil. We can determine the permeability of the fine soil in two ways. One way is to use an approximation equation known as Hazen's Equation and the other is to find it experimentally in the lab. The following are the results of the two calculations.
As can be seen from the above approximations of the coefficient of permeability of the fine sand, Hazen's Equation is off by an order of magnitude when compared to our laboratory result. Hazen's Equation is only off by one order of magnitude which is not as far off as one would think due to the wide range of magnitudes that soils can have, yet it clearly is not as accurate as actual laboratory tests. Hazen's Equation was found through observations made during experiments for loose, uniform sands. Because of this, if we are not using loose, uniform sands, then this approximation loses its accuracy as can be seen from the results.
The seepage loss beneath both dam designs has been determined to be excessive. The seepage loss beneath dam Design 1 was found to be 10.35 cubic feet per day while the seepage loss beneath dam Design 2 was found to be 6.21 cubic feet per day.
The seepage loss under your dam may be the single most important parameter in determining the stability of your dam because if the loss is too great, the soil beneath the dam may wash away, destroying the dam with it.
The following shows the seepage loss under your proposed dam for both design 1 and design 2. The following equation was used in the determination of the seepage loss:
(6)
The addition of the seepage blanket would effectively increase the number of equipotential drops below the dam which would decrease the seepage loss. The blanket lengthens the distance in which the water must travel which decreases the amount of water that can flow beneath the dam in a given day. This in effect decreases the seepage loss. A length of at least ½ the length of the dam is recommended for safety purposes.
From the conclusion of our testing we have been able to determine the classification of the two soils, the suitability of the coarse sand as a filter, the permeability of the fine soil, and the estimated seepage loss beneath the dam in each design. The coarse soil was found to be poorly graded sand, SP, while the fine soil was found to be clayey sand, SC. With this we were then able to determine that the coarse sand met all criteria required to be a filter for the fine sand. We were also able to determine the coefficient of permeability of the coarse and fine soils as 8.7x10-3 cm/sec and 6.57x10-7 cm/sec respectively and also compare them to Hazen's equation approximation. We were able to determine that Hazen's equation is not an appropriate approximation in this situation due to certain assumptions needed to use that equation. Also, we were able to determine that the estimated seepage loss beneath dam Design 1 and dam Design 2 were 10.35 cubic ft per day and 6.21 cubit feet per day, respectively, which is excessive by our standards. With this we recommend adding a seepage blanket in front of both designs which would allow the seepage loss to drop to an acceptable level.
